The room is very clean, many pillows and very comfortable pillows, big room and beautiful room decoration and set. The view from my room very nice, directly to the garden+pool whenever open the window. The hotel is not a 5 star hotel. Rooms are extremely stuffy as the aircon will not work in the winter- only warm air will come out. No USB charging points- ridiculous for a five star hotel to not have this. The food and service was fabulous. Loved their breakfast. Sura Hagia is in the heart of Istanbul, close to the Blue Mosque and Spice Markets.

Wyndham Istanbul Oldcity,"The staff provided outstanding service throughout, diligently working to match the establishment's elegant atmosphere. Its prime location is ideal for major attractions, conveniently situated near subway and tram stations for easy access to key sites. While the breakfast and dinner offerings are modest and not particularly extravagant, they are satisfactory if you're not looking for a lavish dining experience. Wyndham Hotel Istanbul Old City is renowned for its exceptional amenities and outstanding service. One remarkable highlight of this hotel is its amazing buffet, offering a wide array of delicious dishes to satisfy your tastes and cravings. However, the decor is slightly gaudy and tacky – the chandelier, for example, looks like it came out of a Christmas cracker. Istanbul Holiday is located in the Fatih district of the city. The hotel is close to all tourist locations and has great food options. The rooms are very small compared to other hotels and are also a little dated. The pool desperately needs some maintenance and attention. The haman bath is amazing and Mr Murat's service at the dining hall is excellent. Istanbul Old City Hotel is a 5 star hotel in Istanbul, Turkey. The hotel is located near the metro and is a 10 minute walk from the city centre. The food at the hotel is very poor and the cleanliness is subpar. The staff are friendly but not very helpful. The water in the hotel has a bad smell and taste. The hotel will soon be under the Wyndham group management. The roof pool is a reasonable size, the spa pool is even bigger. Breakfast was good, but for sure it can be improved. Majority of Istanbul attractions are within walking distance. Pools are nice, but water in the  indoor pool was extremely cold. City View with No Windows. Great value for money. Horrible experience - you can hear everything! - Stay Away - Honemoon in Istanbul. -  Stay away from Honemoons in Istanbul -   Stay Away from honemoons.com -  "

YOTEL Istanbul Airport Hotel (Landside),"Yotel Istanbul Land Side is a great hotel for transit passengers through Istanbul. The food was great and so was the service everyone was super nice and accommodating. The rooms are very modern and clean. The lobby smells bad. The staff are friendly but if you are a couple and need two room keys, you have to ask for it. Yotel Istanbul Aiport is located inside the airport terminal so perfect for a tired traveler on an overnight connection. Rooms modern and functional,  lighting cold, bathroom okay - really just a plastic pod. Outrageously expensive for what you get, taking advantage of location in the huge airport of Istanbul. Yotel Istanbul (Landside) is a great place to overnight in Istanbul for a tour and flight the following day. After recent remodel, this place is way easier to find among the BladeRunner-isque mall that is the IST International Airport. The restaurant in the place was decent and had a good bar."

The included breakfast buffet is the  best value of staying at RIU. The only thing preventing a 5-star rating for us was the heating unit in our room, which emi. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco. The hotel is in a prime location for touring the city. It is a great place to stay during a vacation. The breakfast buffet is a highlight of the stay. The room temperature is kept at a temperature that is monitored by a machine."
Hotel Emblem San Francisco,"Location, friendliness, price - 5 Stars - A perfect introduction to San Francisco. May 2021 Company Retreat @ Hotel Embelm - Boutique Hotel - Excellent Location - Undisclosed Mandatory WiFi Charge - $29 - Great Stay in Beautiful Boutique hotel - Walls Are Paper Thin - Fab boutique hotel near Union Square. The staff at the Emblem were all friendly, welcoming and helpful. The common areas, the bar and the rooms are all maintained very well. The location is excellent, near Union Square, shopping, restaurants and transportation to everywhere in the city. The food was amazing, the venue was beautiful and the service was top notch. Hotel Emblem has a bohemian flair, but the books in the lobby are what really got me excited. The video fireplace…of books burning…was a very nice touch. The bar is unlike any hotel bar I’ve ever been in. Everyone was friendly, the bartender made great drinks."
LUMA Hotel San Francisco,"Luma Hotel is a brand new hotel in San Francisco. The hotel is located between Chase Center and Oracle Park. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. The rooms are smartly designed and have sweeping views of the bay. The rooftop bar serves creative cocktails to toast another Warriors win and historic game. Luma pretends that it is a full service, luxury hotel. In actuality, it is just a limited service, Vertical Motel. Order room service and a robot will deliver. There is no restaurant but for a coffee shop ten minutes away with a queue."
Chancellor Hotel on Union Square,"Great location, lovely, although quite small room - Coffee, Tea, Hot Water & Delicious Cookies in the Lobby - Charming hotel, great location - Great place to get around SF - Great hotel in Union Square - An absolute gem of a hotel - A quick visit - In the heart of the City - Quirky traditional stay.

The combination of great service, comfortable accommodation, and reasonable prices make it an excellent choice forAnyone visiting theCity. The staff, including Joan, Shirley, Jem, David, Zina, and Linda, provided exceptional customer service during my two-week stay. The Chancellor Hotel is in a prime position opposite Union Square and in close walking access to cable cars, Powell St. The hotel offers you more than the standard hotel with complimentary 24/7 coffe/tea, freshly baked cookies, bowl of fruit and iced lemon infused water."
Hyatt Regency San Francisco,"The Hyatt Regency is one of the best hotels in San Francisco due to its waterfront location while still being in downtown and across from the Embarcadero and pier. It has a great Regency club at the rooftop with a great view. The food was good, but it kept coming out in small batches. The hotel is in a great location, is clean and modern, and has great staff. The hotel rooms and gym are clean andModern. Dining options are very limited. There’s a food market for snacks and beverages and a bar on site with very limited menu. The lobby bar and restaurant has been thoroughly refreshed. It feels very intimate despite being in the middle of the cavernous lobby/atrium. The atrium itself now has lots of wooden benches, sofas, and plugs for charging. In-room renovations have likewise created a comfortable environment you might want to linger in. ompany party. We dpo  - Great Service and Cleanliness - A Property In A Fantastic Location....That Needs A Little TLC - Hyatt Embarcadero getaway. Impressive venue, good service and great location for family city break. Not worth the stay during Covid."
Hotel Griffon,"Special Boutique Hotel in the Embarcadero Area! - Location, Location, location - Best recommendation for any hotel?  You wish you could have stayed longer! - Not Worth the Price - Wedding Night - Favorite place to stay! - Housekeeping at 5:00 PM???? - Go-To - Great find! - Great personnel and excellent location  - Best hotel in SF Hotel Griffon charges daily amenity fees which are not included in online advertising. The 4pm check in time was a major surprise. Cleaning crew did not arrive until 5pm Saturday evening which was too late. Maintenance/construction crew was drilling into later afternoon - Amazing came to hotel Griffon and REGINA  was awesome very attentive and warming made the check in experience great would definitely recommend 10/10. The Griffon is in a location…on the Embarcadero. Perry’s restaurant is on site and excellent. The staff is professional and helpful. Some rooms are small but well priced. Choose a room facing the Bay for a welcoming view. The rooms have no microwave or fridge and are abit  small though but enough for a solo stay. The hotel is great for walking to Oracle Park, Ferry building, Alcatraz tour. The food at Perrys and bar below were great and ultra convenient. The lighting was either very bright or dark, no in between. The room was stuffy, the AC was on the lowest setting but still didn't cool the room. Brandon and Diana went above and beyond. had a beautiful King Room with a beautiful view of the Bay. The location was fantastic, just steps away from the piers and lots of great restaurant options. We will be back. -  Outstanding customer service. -  Highly recommendable."
"BEI San Francisco, Trademark Collection by Wyndham","10/10 Experience. We felt like royalty here! - My second home in San Fran! - Beautiful Hotel with a Beautiful Staff! - Location plus and minus - Profoundly mediocre. - Another Great Stay in the Heart of SF - Disappointing. - Clean rooms with convenient location to Folsom. The rooms are bare bones basic. The carpet is dirty and super stained. The cleaners were really nice and helpful but the front staff could be hit or miss. The hotel is located deep in the homelessness area and you will see people taking drugs and passed out just outside the entrance. It is not a safe area at night. The hotel is a public nuisance due to the employees' union constantly striking with bullhorns out front. The $35 per night “amenity fee” was not included in the “fees” portion I prepaid, which doesn’t make sense. The room was clean but super minimal. ming through their bullhorns, as well as listen to drivers honking in support.

Hotel Caza Fisherman's Wharf,"Hotel Caza is located close to Fisherman's Wharf. The rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable. The staff were very accommodating and pleasant to deal with. The beds are comfortable, but the pillows are so flat - not comfortable or supportive at all. Hotel Caza is in Fisherman's Wharf, close to the Embarcadero and Pier 39. Great location, great staff, great parking, clean rooms, games in the lobby like pool and shuffleboard, bikes to use. Not good with communication or return of room deposits. Hotel Caza at Fisherman’s Wharf was a fun place to stay. The rooms were clean and well appointed. The staff were friendly and helpful. The bar was well stocked. For San Francisco this hotel was very reasonably priced. For a family vacation, stay here! You won’t be disappointed!"
Hotel Zephyr San Francisco,"The Zephyr is a step above other hotels in the Hyde street / Bay Street areas. The hotel has a games room with a pool table, among other things. The marshmallow barbecue by the fire in the courtyard is also perfect. If you are looking for a hotel that is close to Pier 39, you can easily walk there. Hotel Zephyr is in a great location and easy to get to downtown, China town as well as other places of interest. The beds were comfortable and the staff were friendly. Sadly the hotel is outdated - the rooms are horrible and old (see photos). There was a large and noisy air conditioner at the foot of my bed. Hotel is clean, filled with fun/unique decor, with comfy beds & beautiful views. We particularly loved the back patio with fire pits, games, and evening s'mores kits available for purchase. This is the perfect hotel to be right in the action without feeling overwhelmingly touristy."
Hotel Zoe Fisherman's Wharf,"The hotel recently changed ownership (within last 2 weeks) but didn’t miss a beat in providing exceptional service for our first trip ever to the Fisherman’s Wharf area. The location of the hotel meant you could walk to the warf, where there were plenty of shops and restaurants. Hotel messed up my reservation, then double charged for the room by ""forgetting"" to issue a refund to my card, despite numerous calls at the time. Offers complimentary coffee/tea every morning and smores in the evening. The location is perfect, and they share a discount with you to use at restaurants walking distance away at Pier 39. Hotel Zoe was a new hotel to stay at for us. It’s clean, the staff is friendly and the location is perfect. The restaurant/bar is lovely with good food and an attentive staff. The S’mores on the patio at night were a pleasant surprise. Hotel Zoe is located just a few minutes' walk from the fabulous Fisherman's Wharf and some of the best restaurants in San Francisco. Main issues, staff unwilling to assist or offer assistance, access to all lobby bathrooms/courtyard without using the 1 elevator with access to floor 1R & heavy doors without electric opening assist. Hotel is well located but you are charged $40 per room per night for resort fees and the parking is $75 per night. Room are clean but do not include tea or coffee making facilities. Coffee is available in the morning in the lobby  - Sisters tripThe room was very comfortable and the restaurant had very good food and the service was exceptional. , Perfect VacationMy now-wife and I were looking for a place to stay for our elopement in San Francisco. We found Hotel Zoe through AARP (not just for old folks now) and thought it would suffice to crash at the end of the night. Little did we know this would be the best hotel stay of our lives."
The Westin St. Francis San Francisco on Union Square,"Jeff Aquino was the concierge there during our stay he went above and beyond and every way possible so patient helpful and pleasant. He helped my boyfriend set up a surprise room service Champagne bottle with a pretty fruit basket and a card that made my day. Jeff never forgot our names and greeted us everyday, sure made us feel important. If I had a business I would hire Jeff to represent my establishment. The Westin St. Francis San Francisco on Union Square is located in San Francisco's Union Square. The hotel is located near the famous San Francisco Bay Area landmark, the Golden Gate Bridge. The Westin has been in the same building since 1854. The Hotel has a history of being a popular destination for tourists. Westin At Union Square is a great hotel for solo or business trip. Jeff Aquino was definitely a big part of this beautiful hotel experience. He was very welcoming and was a joy to talk to. The elevators were the fastest and most efficient I’ve ever seen. The hotel sits at Union Square, and this time of year, it is the place to be. The lobby is large and clean, and the staff at check-in as well as the concierge and the valets are all very helpful. The only complaint is that the bed was very firm, and I have back pain and hip pain, exacerbated by laying on trigger points, so, I didn't get much sleep. The Westin is located near fantastic shopping and restaurants. The hotel is beautifully decorated and it’s quiet. The bar manager is a disgrace to the hotel he works in the clock bar he was so rude. The staff in the coffee dock were amazing and good fun. The hotel was beautiful. The cleanliness of the hotel was superb. The beds are comfortable. The location is convenient. The service is what made this stay stand above others. Every encounter with hotel personal was pleasant. Exceptional service was encountered at the concierge. I will be back at The Westin for all SF stays."
Hotel Nikko San Francisco,"Hotel Nikko is my favorite hotel in San Francisco. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and modern with all the amenities of a luxury hotel. The staff is very professional, especially the front desk, and they go out their way to make the customers feel special. The hotel is always very clean and comfortable. The amenities are excellent and the staff is professional and friendly. The gym and pool area are wonderful. The breakfast buffet is delicious. The best part of our hotel experience is how we felt calmness throughout our stay. Calm luxury is experiencing SF Nikko. Hotel Nikko is a gem that is  not to be missed. The location is excellent, within easy walking distance of the Moscone Center, Union Square, China Town, and many great restaurants. The staff are super friendly and helpful. And, Johnny Foley's Irish House is just across the street! Hotel Nikko is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco. The location is within easy reach of all the Downtown shopping and restaurants like nearby Union Square. The hotel is classy without the high prices.

Argonaut Hotel,"The Argonaut is the best pet friendly hotel in San Francisco. It is a perfect location for walking around the park, beach and restaurants. Restaurant was great —delicious breakfasts and a nice spot for cocktails. The room was the perfect size and tastefully decorated with a great view of the water. The Argonaut is located on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. The hotel has a great location and is well situated for the city's attractions. The room was unimpressive and the room was noisy. The restaurant was very good but the menu was a bit limited. The hotel is directly in front of Fisherman’s wharf, close to restaurants and shops, right next to cable cars, with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. The restaurant has a delicious crab chowder as well as a crab breakfast omelette. My negative points include the high cost ( and several additional taxes) and the impossibility to ever find the concierge. The Argonaut is located at the end of Fisherman's Wharf. Food at the Restaurant is delicious. I especially loved the chowder, yummy - Friendly Staff, Great Location. A much needed get away after 2 years of not traveling. - Pretty terrible place - Friendly staff - Great location. - Great service considering situation - Ideal! - Location, location, location."
Hyatt Regency San Francisco Downtown SOMA,"The front desk staff was unprofessional and needs customer service and customer satisfaction training. The cafe staff was very nice and professional. The market in the lobby also had some pretty good options. The carrot cake was really good and I’m glad they - Great Hotel Hyatt Regency SOMANice clean rooms, great view of the city, hills, and bay. The hotel was immaculate and lovely, and Ms. Sara was incredibly kind and helpful. The rooms were clean, and I could view the sunsets each morning from the lovely window view. The staff in the Market Place were exceptional. It was easy to walk to the Ferry Building and Union Square. Hotel is Bleak; Lobby is Noisy and Uninviting; Management is Rude and Uncaring. Breakfast barely above airline standards and very oddly layer out buffet. In the gym not all peloton bikes worked, the toaster in the morning was slow. Artisan coffees in breakfast cost extra. y -    y -  -  y   - y - y  - - y - y.y -y  - Y -  Y.y.y   Y - yy - Y.Y - Y - Y  -"
Fairmont San Francisco,"The hotel is an ideal location to a lot of key attractions. The staff at the hotel are tremendous. The views of San Francisco Bay are outstanding. As Platinum ALL members, our suite was upgraded before we arrived to one with a magnificent view. The shades in the bathroom were not functional. Windows were disgusting with hand prints. The hotel's website is definitely showing Christmas photos from sometime ago. The pillows were probably the worst hotel pillows I've ever experienced. The Tonga Room felt like a frat party. It's sad because you can tell at one point this hotel was the height of sophistication, but it's sadly been run down. The life size gingerbread house means the lobby is filled with the smell of gingerbread, the christmas tree and tea room were gorgeously decorated. The only negative was the mediocre $60 buffet, which you couldn’t opt out of. Valet parking onsite and champagne tree! The Fairmont San Francisco is a five star hotel. It is located in the heart of San Francisco. The hotel is close to Fisherman’s Wharf and Chinatown. The Fairmont is located on the San Francisco Bay. It has a reputation for being a great value for money."
Stanford Court San Francisco,"Great family hotel in Nob Hill, San Francisco. Charming hotel with a boutique-like feel. Very nice hotel and excellent location. Great but not worth the price. Not Ready For Prime Time - Exceed expectation  - Old School Charm Freshly Updated With Urban Touches - Great Location and Awesome Vibe! The bed in our Deluxe Queen Room was small, but the room was very clean, had all the amenities, and a great view over the road. The breakfast cost was extortionate for what it was serving and for the poor quality of some of the items. Even at the price of $36pp, the boiled eggs and some cans of Coke were to be paid extra. The Stanford Court is located on Nob Hill next to the Mark Hopkins (The Top of the Mark), the Fairmont, and a number of top restaurants, as well as on the Powell cable car line, just above Union Square and Chinatown. The lack of stars is purely due to the quality of sleep or lack of. windows. The hotel is located at the top of a hill, but the tram stops literally at the front of the hotel. It is a much safer and quieter area of SF but it is quite a walk up some serious hills to get out for dinner or to the shops. We would stay here again but would request and inside courtyard room which are quieter."
Hyatt Place San Francisco Downtown,The room was spacious and up-to-date. Housekeeping was available every day. Plenty of places to eat within walking distance and Doordash was super fast. The only thing that would have made it better is if coffee would have been available earlier for people who are traveling somewhere to work. The ambience of the hotel was relaxing. The rooms spacious and clean and the staff was exceptional. The included breakfast was a cut above the average. The lack of agency about the bathroom lighting by having a motion sensor light that you could not turn off was a customer unfriendly choice.
Axiom Hotel,"The Axiom hotel is located in the heart of San Francisco. The hotel has an Executive King room that is just over 320 square feet. Watch out for extra fees when booking the hotel, which is a lot. Clean and friendly but poorly designed. Cleanliness was borderline... and finally I met a beggar in the lobby. The Axiom Hotel is located in the heart of San Francisco. The hotel is close to Union Square and the Moscone Center. The rooms are quiet and well amentized. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. The bed was not comfortable; the middle of the bed was sunk in. The pillows were also flimsy. Hotel Axiom San Fransisco is located on the cable car line and the BART station line at Powell St. The hotel was quiet and clean. There is 24/7 valet. The food at breakfast I thought as very good. The cable car tracks and waiting lines are right outside the door. tastic location but... - Wonderful stay! - Great value for San Fran - Cute, clean, comfortable, and great service - Axiom hotel - Felt the vibe - Watch out for extra fees when booking -    Axiom hotel is located in San Francisco's Mission District."
Marriott Marquis San Francisco,"$500 security deposit required at check in!!!!Hotel may be nice, but thoroughly annoyed by the fact that at check-in they required a $500 (yes five hundred dollars!!!!!!!!!) security deposit on a $775 stay. - Awful Low M-Club StandardsGreat room, club level, very poor standards! The standards in the end club are no longer worth having. Hotel is large and somewhat impersonal in its public spaces. Has very much the feel of a conference hotel, not one for a romantic weekend away. Rooms are a good size, with firm beds and well-appointed bathrooms. For a largish hotel, the elevators were fast and efficient too. The hotel is beautiful and located with within walking distance to the Gaslamp District and the ocean. The perks of breakfast /evening happy hour on the second floor was great for Bonvoy members. Avoid the Blue section of the hotel. The latest checkout that was offered was 12:30 PM, which really did not help with our schedule. The hotel is nice in many respects and the staff is competent and friendly. The fitness center is quite incredible, possibly the biggest and best I've ever seen in a hotel. The view is rather poor but, frankly, that is not as big of an issue. The big issue is that trash dumpsters are in that area and the trash trucks come in the worst possible hours. The hotel is huge & lovely. Spacious lobby with access to Mission & 4th streets. Good rooms. Service is inconsistent - some staff members were warm while some did not wear a customer hat. While the breakfast arena & service were good, the spread can be worked on. Customer service is not a priority for elite members. The hotel is great if you want a central location and clean spacious room. The rooftop bar is amazing. The rooms were clean and the front desk staff always had a smile. The bed was really cold and I got really cold at night. Would not stay here again."
San Francisco Marriott Fisherman's Wharf,"The hotel provides paid parking, and you can keep the car even after checkout, depending on when you checked in. The hotel had a restaurant in its lobby, and it was reasonable. However, you also have many options nearby in walking distance. The room we stayed in was on the 5th floor, and outside the window, we did not have any great view. The restaurant was pricey, but there are plenty of good food venues nearby. Restaurant staff was excellent. Our granddaughter has food allergies. They brought her food directly from kitchen to prevent cross contamination at the buffet. The room was clean and mattress comfortable. The location of this hotel is a short walk to fishermans wharf and cable cars. The hotel is close to the famous San Francisco landmark, Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel offers a $30 drink credit at the hotel bar, but it may not get applied to your total. The location is perfect, close to many nice restaurants and attractions! The rooms and hotel lobby are clean and updated and there is an option for breakfast in their restaurant. The hotel is located in the heart of the Fisherman's Wharf/Embarkadaro area of San Francisco. It is within walking distance to Pier 39, Pier 33 (for Alcatraz), cable car/trams, Chinatown, Italian town. The hotel, as most upscale in San Francisco, adds on required extras whether you plan to use them or not. The hotel is ideally close for Fishermans Wharf, local restaurants etc. The staff were fantastic and polite, the hotel was clean. The room is probably the smallest I’ve stayed. The only highlight is that the room has a lot charging ports. When booking, we are promised a lot: good city view, higher floor and away from elevator. Hotel room was extremely clean is one the most important things when choosing a place to stay. The hotel is dog friendly and has a bar. Good location to walk to San Francisco locations such as Pier 39, Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman’s Wharf, Lombard street."
Hilton San Francisco Financial District,"Hilton San Francisco Financial District is one of the better Hiltons in the city. The hotel is located in the heart of the city's financial district. The location is great, with Chinatown, North Beach, and historic Portsmouth Square nearby. The rooms were a good size and the wrap around desk was great. The staff of this hotel were consummate professionals. The hotel was immaculate, and our conference went off without a hitch thanks to the staff. The food was far above average for conference food, too!  - 27th Floor = Stunning views. - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly - Great San Francisco Hotel Option - Decent Stay with Few Amenities - Solid overall property for a general stay - Dirty and unsafe - Stain on my first trip to San Francisco."
The Donatello,"Great location, super close to Union Square. Rooms are absolutely huge and feel so spacious. Bed is extremely large and sup sup. Hotel room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Only negative, if I had to name one, was the shower water pressure. The staff was always friendly and willing to help. The jazz music in the - Beautiful hotel. The Donatello is a 15 story full service old style hotel near union square. Rooms are incredibly spacious - big couch and coffee table, mini bar area, desk. There is a fitness/jacuzzi/coffee bar on the 15th floor which has complimentary coffee and a little area to read the paper."
Cow Hollow Inn and Suites,"Reccommended - Clean and Comfortable - Nice hotel in great location - Very Noisy - Large suite clean and comfortable - Average - Vacation - Bring Ear Muffs. Close by tourist sites, food, coffee and local shopping/boutiques. Recommend getting a Muni day pass where you can travel on buses, trams, cable cars all day. Hotel is convenient to public transportation and close to tourist sites. Staff were always friendly and made us feel welcome. Rooms were spacious, comfortable bed & pillows and nice shower. Garage parking included with stay! Accommodations are nice. Soft bed, comfortable room, window view, I was hoping the hotel had a bathtub. Cow Hollow is a very good economic hotel. Rooms were clean and the bed was comfy. The location is great. The staff is friendly and willing to meet your demands. The only issue I had was one night (Saturday night) with the parking. It was a weekend and we just returned at night after sightseeing. The Cow Hollow is only 10 min away from the hospital with free self parking. The staff was very professional, efficient and friendly. The rooms were clean, comfortable and well-appointed. The location is convenient and centrally located for access to the Golden Gate Bridge, Marin Headlands, Presidio and most of San Francisco's more popular tourist destinations."
San Remo Hotel,"More a hostel than a hotel. Still no refund after 7 months! - Lack of communication is disgraceful. Ignoring all phone calls/emails - Communication difficulty. Value for money in excellent location. - Quaint and convenient! - Old time hotel close to the wharf and cable car. The San Remo Hotel is located in a quiet neighbourhood near Fishermans Wharf and the cable car. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are shared, but this was never a problem. The hotel provides robes and ear plugs which were nice to have. There is a quite time from 10pm to 6am that was respected by most of the clients. San Remo is a unique gem with rich history. The rooms were small, taking out the wardrobe would be a huge help. The location is great and we enjoyed walking to Lombard St, Ghirardelli, Fisherman’s Wharf, and Pier 39. The San Remo Hotel is located in San Francisco's Fishermans Wharf area. The hotel is set above the oldest Italian restaurant in America, it’s a prime location for a stay. The rooms are all in close quarters, and the hall ways are very noisy. San Remo feels like a museum once you walk in, with the walls covered in history. Staff were always around making sure areas were clean and presentable. Fresh brew coffee for free and the massage chairs were a nice touch. Highly recommend and I’d stay here again."
Hyatt Centric Fisherman's Wharf San Francisco,"The hotel is walking distance to the Wharf, Lombard Street, and many other locations. It has very safe underground valet parking. Bikes are provided as part of the stay. The room was spotless and kept dust free over the entire two weeks we were there. The hotel is close to Powell Street Cable Car end point, Fisherman's Wharf, and other San Francisco tourist attractions. Included breakfast buffet made it convenient to eat and then start the day's activities. Bikes scooters onsite. Location to the waterfront couldn't be better, but was a little nervous outside due to the amount of homeless folks sleeping on the sidewalks. The hotel is located within a block of the F Street Trolley and three blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. No Top Sheets on the Bed - Hotel policy. The staff at the restaurant was outright rude and the service was non existent. The bathroom was also leaking, the breakfast was charged incorrectly... in short, everything was terrible. The Hyatt Centric Hotel is centrally located near Fisherman's Wharf. The rooms were very clean and the staff did a great job making sure we had enough towels and essentials for our room. The breakfast was excellent, and service was good, but the pantry was absurdly priced. Hotel is close to Fishermans Wharf, Pier 39 and the Golden Gate Bridge. Elevators are a little wacky with their setup, but you just have to deal with that. The room was tidy but a little outdated and the whole hotel looks in need of a refresh."
Grant Plaza Hotel,"The Grant Plaza Hotel is located in the heart of Union Square. It's just steps away from some of the best shopping, dining, and entertainment options in the city. The hotel itself has a quaint, old-school charm that adds to the overall experience. While the bathrooms may be a bit small, they're perfectly functional. The rooms at this hotel are small, but for the low rate, I can't complain much. Despite the size, the room was clean and well-maintained, and the bed was comfortable. Overall, if you're looking for a budget-friendly option and don't mind small rooms, this hotel is a great choice. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel also had a great breakfast buffet that was included in the room rate. The rate here is much cheaper than anywhere else with similar amenities. The service was decent, not that I used a lot of it, but the location was perfect. The Grant Plaza Hotel is in the heart of Chinatown, on a slope. It is only a 10-minute walk from Montgomery station, although if you're arriving from the airport be prepared to drag your bags uphill. The hotel is smack dab in the middle of Chinatown in a rather busy area. The room itself was pretty standard, but the bathroom and shower were excellent. There is a parking garage about 5 min walking distance away that you can reserve through the front desk at a reduced rate. An extra charge of 18 dollars will be charged for placing luggage in advance, the two beds on the order will be changed to one, and the extra bed service will be charge separately."
Parc 55 San Francisco - a Hilton Hotel,"Parc 55 is located in downtown San Francisco. The hotel is located just blocks away from great shopping. The complimentary food options and bar service makes the hotel an excellent choice. The free wifi was very poor. The room was okay and did have a view but otherwise I wouldn’t call it deluxe. The hotel is in an ideal location, close to shopping, entertainment and dining. The front desk agent Christina Campbell went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect. The food in the hotel was yes, expensive. The hotel is close to ALLLLL the shopping and I do mean all the shopping. The Parc 55 is located close to the Cable Car turnaround, theaters, restaurants, and shopping in Union Square. Our room was spacious, comfortable, and quiet, with a spectacular view. The fitness facility is extremely well-equipped, the on-site restaurants are top-notch, plus the staff is attentive, friendly, and thoughtfully friendly."
Stanyan Park Hotel,"The Stanyan is a very convenient hotel by UCSF. Its also by Haight Ashbury district. They have a wonderful free continental breakfast and happy hour which was really nice and great selection. The hotel is an old SF hotel and a bit noisy but worth it for the reasons above. Stanyan Park Hotel is close by UCSF Medical Center and across from Golden Gate Park. Although rooms are smallish, they are comfortable. Breakfast (included) is excellent. Large quality choices  I would stay again - Rats!!!!My family checked in new years eve. after the new years fireworks at the bay we found rats had eaten the complementry chocolates left by housekeeping and laid droppings in our beds. We had to find new accomodations at 2am on new years day. The hotel staff didnt even offer to help find a new hotel, and there reaction told us they knew about the rats. It took 30 minutes to even get my card refunded The hotel was last renovated in the early 80s, and it shows. The carpets are badly stained, the wallpaper is pealing off, and the rooms smell strongly of mildew. The staff is amazing and way more patient than they have to be. The location a block from the Haight and right at the edge of Golden Gate Park was fantastic. The location of the hotel is amazing. The price is extremely competitive. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The room and hotel itself is very clean. The only drawback is that there is no heating or AC. It can get cold if you're not used to the climate there (but I'm from TX). Stanyan Park is right next to Golden Gate Park which is a wonderful stroll to the beach. The continental breakfasts are tasty but the quality and taste of their coffee could use improvement. The room was adequate and the mattress comfortable. The deodorant for cleaning has a strong over-powering smell. Stanyan Park Hotel is a charming historic hotel that has been lovingly restored and updated. The hotel is directly across the street from Golden Gate Park. The staff are friendly and helpful (even to supercilious guests - I saw one or two that made me cringe) The hotel offers tea time in mid afternoon and a wine and cheese time in early evening. The Stanyan is listed on the National Historical Register. It is a great place to stay. It's not fancy but it is clean and comfortable. Staff is great. Afternoon tea and wine and cheese reception is a nice touch. I will definitely stay here again if I'm in the San Francisco area. The hotel is situated in good neighbourhood, with bus and street car a short walk away. Staff at reception were very helpful and gave good advice and direction. The Golden Gate Park is right across the road and this is an amazing place to walk or cycle. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others. - 6 day stay."
Park Grand London Hyde Park,"The staff are amazing  they are kind and helpful,Thank  you Mubashir,jeana,Stella and Mudassir, Stella was so kind, well done guys. Hotel is close to Paddington station, just a 5 min walk. Streets are cozy and quiet. The Park Grand London Hyde Park Hotel is located near Paddington Station. The hotel has a full English and buffet style breakfast. The room service is excellent and the condition of the room furniture is great too. The only issue was the ac as it was too hot. The staff are so friendly and have great communication skills. The hotel is convenient to Paddington Station which is great. The basement room was too small to open our suitcase and be able to move in the room. The last comment is the sound rodents moving through the walls/ceiling. Rooms are decently sized for London standards with great cleaning staff. Location is a plus, near the park, walkway to Paddington station. The room are small but absolutely quite. The breakfast was fresh and good. Not too much options but all with good flavor. All staff was very kind and receptive. Special retreats for Mubashir that helped a lot with food bookings. The rooms are very small, and old, the atmosphere smells bad at the hotel except for the lobby. Don't pay for the breakfast, it’s so small and it doesn’t look delicious, compared to the price you pay for it. The best of this hotel stands in his own personal who are highly trained and very welcoming."
Park Grand Paddington Court,"Park grand Paddington is a great hotel with family feeling. The room was a great size and everything was clean. The location is not far from the underground and other transportation. The staff are very friendly especially Kazi,Colston,Shuja and Maisum. The stay was very comfortable. Park Grand Paddington is a great place to stay in London. The rooms were spotless and bed very comfortable. Close to major train stations and bus stops. Not suitable for families. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The hotel is ok! The rooms are clean but a little bit small. The 4 pillows were amazing and I slept good. The reception staff was friendly as well. The hotel was close to paddington station, hyde park and other stores. The next tube station is just a short 5 minute walk away with direct access to central London. The hotel did not live to our expectations of a 4-star hotel. The room was cold and uninviting. The walls in the bathroom constantly had some condensate on leaking towards the floor. The shelf under the basin was full of water. Staff are very friendly, extremely helpful. Location is excellent, close to train/tube. Price is good and competitive. Location was very good, near to the Paddington Station,  very near to High Park also. Staff were extremely friendly. The price was worth it and everything is so close by. A great stopover for me arriving from and departing for Australia. Would definitely book again when I'm next in London."
Travelodge London City hotel,"All good in Aldgate have been using this Travelodge for around 5 years with my current job. It is consistently well turned out, clean, has a good range of meal choices, and with professional staff. Special shout out to Sahel in front of house who is unfailingly ‘on it’ for service. The hotel is in central London and is close to Aldgate tube station. Great location, great staff and great food. Great value for money for a central London hotel. One of the nicer Travelodges I’ve stayed in with lovely staff but was only made aware of substantial construction works after making non refundable booking. The hotel has been recently rennovated and feels modern. The location is more than convenient for all the major attractions, with Liverpool Street and Aldgate East tube stations just a short walk away. First room was very dirty unfortunately. Stained carpet, also transferred hairs onto the bed. Hairs in corners in the bathroom. Even at 30 degrees it was still pretty cold. Great location and excellent service. Room is as I expected for a Travelodge - Comfy and reasonably priced. Great location for both business and wider London excursions. Good value for money. Great value. Good location and great service. Great room. Great service. The Whitechapel Gallery, the Cable Street mural and Old Spitalfields Market are all well worth visiting. The location is very good - we walked along the river to/from the Playhouse Theatre, and enjoyed seeing all the illuminated buildings on the south side."

Travelodge London Kings Cross Royal Scot,"Good for value very well located : by walk 10’ from St Pancras and 30’ away from main touristic locations. Large rooms Average cleanliness which can be improved but it is correct. Be aware that room cleaning is not provided during stay under 7 days. The room was beyond disgusting. Blood stained carpets, the room smelt of awful mold, couldn’t open the windows as it’s too noises, bathroom was full of dust, even coming out the shower head. The whole place has a terrible smell too. Please reconsider to somewhere else if you stay here. Hotel is close to King's Cross station and has a convenient location. Staff were lovely and bubbly and the rooms were clean and tidy. Breakfast had a good selection and was hot but some rooms could do with a bit of a tidy but can’t complain for the price and location. The ubicación was great because is close to the center of London. Not too far from the tube station, and not very cheap. Bathroom not cleaned properly - mold and rust around the bath fittings. No hand-wash in the dispenser. The bar is serving breakfast and dinner as well as multiple drinks and snacks. The bathroom was dirty, the bathtub had black stains. There were not enough hairdryers and when we asked why none were available as the website specified we were told that ""hairdryers being available doens't mean you will get one"" The shower was a lukewarm trickle, the flat pillows insufficient for a good night sleep. The car park at £20 for 24hrs has limited space (we were lucky) and is very dirty with rubbish. The rooms are very basic, but the staff are so friendly, especially Jackie on reception. The rooms are not sound deadened or sound proof, as the neighbouring residents were drunk and noisy waking us up a number of times during our stay. They don't clean the room or bathroom in 6 days. If you use Apple double charging plugs they do not fit room electric sockets. minutes walk from Kings Cross Station. We checked in early and checked out late for only an extra £20! We will be back :) -  We will be  back :) – We checked out early for only a extra £ 20! We checked out  for only  £20. We will  be back. – "

Great food from room service was tasty and made  fresh. The cocktails were impressive as well. The bed was the most comfortable that we ever tried!! - Excellent stay. Hilton Algate is located just 2 minutes from an Underground station and plenty of restaurants nearby. The decor is Asian-inspired, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were spotless, but the hallway carpet on our floor had lots of lint and could have benefited from a daily vacuuming. Hotel’s location is near the Underground, so it is very convenient. It is also walking distance to Spitalfields, and many shops and restaurants. Staff is so helpful and friendly, especially front desk Rahmeer, bartender Amin, and concierge Abdul. Rooms are clean, modern, bed is comfortable, love their pillows. The hotel is convenient to the Tower of London, St. Paul's and St. James' Park.

The Montcalm Royal London House,"Fantastic stay at the Montcalm. The staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us. The Guest Experience Manager, January, was great and made sure that we had a lovely time. The exec lounge evening food offering definitely pales in comparison to some hotels, but they make up for in attentive service, excellent wine and fab onsite restaurant.

Can’t fault anything at all!    Stayed over for the night for the works Christmas party which was close by in Shoreditch. We were very disappointed at the service of the hotel. No extra towels or slippers were provided to go to the pool area. No hot towel rail or laundry lines in the bathroom provide for wet swimming costumes. We could not order any meals/room service without a QR code and the QR code we had was not working in our room. Montcalm Royal is one of London's most exclusive hotels. The Aviary bar at the top of the hotel gave us a breath-taking view over London at night- unforgettable. The spa is another top notch addition, clean and comforting. The hotel room was decorated without me lifting a finger. The Montcalm is a great location for a night out in east London. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. The spa is beautiful and the staff are always smiling. The staff were brilliant and made our stay outstanding.

Great prices. Great people. Great atmosphere. Great views. Great night out. Great hotel. Great restaurant. Great time in the city."
Park Grand London Kensington,"Not a four star really wished we had booked somewhere else. The room itself was dirty stains on the carpet and doors. There was a stench of smoke when we walked in and the carpets were torn as well. Breakfast adequate and staff polite and pleasant. Not a too quality but think better level up from a Premier Inn. Park Grand London is located in a quiet area just off a main road. Service was excellent and the breakfast was excellent. The hotel does not allow a bag drop, so we had to take our cases around London before formal check-in. The carpets in the hallways showed signs of age and had bleach and other marks. Park Grand Hotel is located in Kensington, central London. The hotel is only 2 blocks from Alfred Hitchcock's former residence. The restaurant had the best Indian food I have ever experienced. The rooms are clean and good, so when we go back to London we will certainly book this hotel again. Park Grand Hotel is located near Earls Court station. The hotel is in a great location for a London stay. The room is run down and the hall ways are dark and smell musky. A premier inn is much much better value! Although location convenient near Earl's Court station is strange. Park Grand London Kensington is a beautiful gem in central London. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant was the cheapest of our meals during our trip. We strongly recommend this place for the stay in London. - Perfekt the staff at the reception are wonderful. The Park Grand London Kensington is a great location and a great hotel.

Leonardo Royal Hotel London Tower Bridge,"Hotel leonardo royal city london is located close to Tower Bridge and 3-4 mins walk from Tower Hill Underground station. Hotel offers free use of the leisure club in the basement. Spa day is great with pool, stream room and sauna which you are able to use throughout your stay. Staff at Leo restaurant were amazing and really helpful. The food was delicious, and the staff, particularly our waiter Kazi, was incredibly kind, making our dinner truly special. The VIP lounge is well worth a visit with free drink and food for 2 hours which includes cocktails. The Leonardo Hotel, Tower Hill, London, is a top rated hotel. The hotel has a spa and a top-class restaurant. The restaurant was great and the hotel staff was professional and courteous. The bar staff, Shajib, was so helpful in explaining the options on the menu. The hotel is very nice, comfortable, clean, and modern. Our favorite aspect was the 2 wonderful mixologists at the bar. The hotel room is lovely and spa facilities were great. Only let down was the food which was a shame as we had such a nice lunch. The hotel claims to be a non-smoking hotel but obviously the staff doesn't care at all. On the entire second floor there was an extreme smell of weed two nights in a row - finally also in our room. Christmas dinner (buffet) was far from what we expected and certainly not worth the price. The Leonardo is a five-star hotel in central London. The rooms have robes, slippers, complimentary Nespresso coffee, teas, still and sparkling water, cookies, nightly chocolate chip cookies and more. The hotel was great and staff were very friendly. Xmas Dinner was very limited which was disappointing."
Travelodge London Docklands Central,"The hotel is near the Excel where the Mamma Mia weekend was held. The views from the upper floors across the Thames are stunning. The staff are friendly and professional, the rooms are clean and equipped to a high standard. There isn't much parking, luckily we managed to get the last space available. The bed was hard as a brick! It hurt my back almost instantly, I didn't sleep well and after returning from there last night I am still very sore today. We'll have to stick to Premier Inn from now on, the extra cost is worth it. The hotel was clean and modern and the few staff we encountered were friendly. The view is absolutely breathtaking and I’ve not had a proper good night’s sleep in ages before today. The food options for an evening meal and breakfast were plenty, and very tasty. The staff were one of the most helpful hotel staff I have ever met. Hotel was good value and in a great location for the O2, however the room smelt of sewerage and was very cold. The reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the bed in our room was very comfortable  - Excellent hotel and team. The hotel facilities were great, it was very clean and very well maintained, with drinks and food available at reasonable prices. Travelodge London Docklands has a great location and great rooms. Family room very clean and comfortable, with kingsize bed plus 2 singles (slightly narrow, but OK). AMAZING view over the river towards the city. Tea-coffee re-stocked in bedroom on request. Breakfast not worth having, as not very well stocked. The hotel is located in central London. The hotel is one of the most expensive in the capital.

"The Clermont London, Charing Cross","One night to celebrate a birthday and visit the theatre. A lovely room with a very comfortable bed and plenty of pillows. Big fluffy towels in the bathroom. Nice to have both tea facilities and a pod coffee machine in the room. We were staying to celebrate my wife's birthday and my wife was pleasantly surprised by the birthday message, cake and balloons in the hotel. The Clermont is located on the Embankment, near Charing Cross. The hotel has rich and historic architecture, high ceilings, large Georgian windows, swooping brass stair case, tastefully decorated for Christmas. The food was excellent and very reasonably priced and the outlook was fantastic. Booking system is borked, support staff mostly unhelpful. The Claremont - Charing Cross was the ideal property for our visit. The hotel was centrally located  on The Strand with very nice rooms and just the right amenities. The service we received was charming and quietly efficient and the food we enjoyed was exquisite without exception. The Clermont Charing Cross, London, was the perfect hotel for first time travelers to London. It was steps away from Trafalgar Square, two Tube locations were literally on the property, and rail service was in the bottom of the hotel. The staff were kind and accommodating and the entire hotel was EXTREMELY clean. The hotel is located in the heart of central London. It is a short journey by tube from Victoria station to Charring Cross. The location is perfect for Central London bars, restaurants, etc... Will most likely be back next year for the annual Christmas party. Highly recommend this hotel. The room, bar, restaurant and breakfast were all exceptional. Staff friendly and accommodating. Rooms clean and comfortable. Love the goodies filled in the candy dish. The only reason for 4 stars, rather than 5, has to do with temperature control, loudness,  and special requests. The Clermont is my hotel of choice when I need to stay in London on business. It is in a really good location, and the rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable. Super conveniently located for walking to just about all sites to visit or there’s a tube station is right next door and another line just down the street. The Clermont Hotel is located next to the Charing Cross station. The hotel is beautifully decorated both their permanent and holiday decor were equally tasteful. The staff were attuned to any request we may have had and were very responsive and attentive. We will definitely stay at the Clermon in the future."
Travelodge London Covent Garden,"Hotel is in the heart of London and everything is in walking distance. Restaurant was closed & hotel is in middle of a Refurb. Room was small and did not have a phone to contact reception, or a hairdryer. Disabled hand rail was broken in the bathroom. Hotel being renovated and breakfast facilities closed. No bar or cafe so we were charged full amount for just a room. Hotel was  cold, room heating not working. Room was tiny and hotel a building site..  Got refunded for lack of breakfast but I would never have booked if I knew there was no facilities,  then not allowed to change to another hotel. Never again. Hotel is perfectly situated on Drury Lane for those wanting to visit the theatres or central London. Rooms are clean and reasonably sized. Bar and food facilities were unavailable due to rener actions - pity they didn't notify us of this when we booked only one week before our visit. Hotel is in a prime location within easy walking distance of Covent Garden, Piccadilly, Leicester Square and Seven Dials market. Staff were friendly and helpful, but the bathroom smelled of a public toilet or sewage. No water bottles provided, normally there are water bottles offered. Hotel is close to Covent Garden, Tube stations and Cambridge theatre. Staff were friendly and it was realtively clean, but the bathroom was tiny. Currently undergoing rénovations, which I understand but still full price. No breakfast or dinner options, noise outside, confusing walk ways. Overnight stay perfect for theatreland. Walking distance to everything (Holborn Station, downtown, and a lot of coffee shop). There is also a BK shop crossed to the hotel name Cafe Verona, it's very friendly and great price. The staff were outstanding in their customer care."
Travelodge London Central Kings Cross,"The hotel is in a great location and is good value for money. Family rooms are located on the noisy side, so you will frequently hear the trains throughout the night. The staff especially Bee was so kind and helpful! Helpful that they let us store luggage as we had a meeting to attend. Hotel is located close to Kings Cross and St Pancras stations. Good location but noisy air con outside window made it hard to get to sleep (had to use ear plugs) and poor sluggish wifi (which I had to pay for) - Lovely Stay :)The hotel is located in a good area close to the station and other places to go, the room was really nice, we had a comfortable stay. Location is fantastic, all of the staff were lovely, the room was what we needed, but when I got into the shower I found there was no shower gel in the dispenser, at this point I could not go down to the front desk without having to dry off, get dressed and shower again, so had a thoroughly disappointing shower. Think twice before booking. Staff are lovely, very friendly and helpful. It’s in a great location, easy to catch the trains or buses, we had an excellent stay. Would stay here again if I needed to be near King's Cross. Would definitely come again and recommend to anyone coming soon. Emily and Andrew were the best hostesses I’ve ever experienced. Full of kindness and understanding difficult situations. Service was excellent when solving a problem, and I would definitely consider staying here again next time I'm in London. Beds were comfortable. Would have liked cooked breakfast but not available."

The hotel staffs are kind and attentive to all your demands, the service is at a high quality in all aspects. The manager even took time to have a chat with us and made us a cup of coffee."

The facilities were very clean and tidy, and all staff seemed very friendly. The walk from the Excel to the hotel was dreadful, under a bypass, past old mattresses and pushchairs. The hotel downstairs was clean but the room was smelly and the bathroom unclean."
The Royal Horseguards,"The Royal Horseguards is a five star hotel on the Thames opposite the London eye. We stayed in room 511 which was an internal room with a half glazed widow to an area that house air conditioning ducting. The noise was quite loud and made it difficult to sleep. The room was very cold when we arrived and the aircon takes many hours to warm it up, the lighting system is unnecessarily complicated and the bar was closed. We could order drinks to have in the lobby but that's not the same as a hotel bar! - Excellent afternoon tea tania had great service. The Royal Horseguards is an excellent hotel. It's a luxury hotel that feels like home. The service was top-notch, the holiday decorations were beautiful and the room was spacious and very clean. It is only a 2 minute walk from the Embankment tube station and the London Eye, Big Ben, Parliament and Westminster Abbey are all in walking distance. One Whitehall Place is in the heart of London, in the walking distance to all all main attractions. Great food, great food, direct view to London eye from our room and we watch the show from our hotel room. The best, helpful and professional staff. Most probably the best hotel in Europe we have been. The hotel is wonderful, steeped in history and luxurious. The rooms are spacious and the bed are very comfortable. The restaurant is excellent.

Would like to come back soon in summers for holidays.  - Fantastic stay, super friendly staff."
The Tower Hotel,"The Tower Hotel has some of the best views in London. The staff are friendly and the room itself is spotless. The bathroom is what made me want to leave before my check out date. The toilet did not flush properly. The bank of the bathroom door was filthy. The Tower is a great location, easy transit access, restaurants and attractions. The location is brilliant with the tube nearby and the Tower of London a stones throw away. The hotel is dated and in need of updating. The bathroom needs a little refreshing, but perfectly serviceable. The views from Hotel are amazing the service and the breakfast were excellent, the room very spacious comfy and tidy. The staff was very responsive to any and all needs that needed to be met, and the location was great. The rooms were cleaned daily,  witb fresh towels a d water every day  They also provided hot drunks as well. The hotel rooms are very old style and needs renovation. The view is unmatched, however, the cleanliness of this hotel is the worst I have ever experienced. The rooms are dates and not worth the money or rubbish service. We booked 2 rooms through Expedia for tower hotel poor service wouldn’t help changed. Hotel is a little dated, bathrooms need a refurb. View is unbeatable and received a free upgrade which included a free night's sleep. Staff were excellent and facilities were great. Already booked for next year. Hope to be back one day! - We deserve better. The hotel and facility where excellent The view from our room of tower bridge was beautiful. The restaurant downstairs the service was A*. The hotel staff helps us upgrade and gave us late check out. The hotel is also very outdated, terrible rancid smell about corridors and one of the worst breakfasts I have ever had. The Tower Hotel met with evey expectation, friendly,  comfortable, clean with good food and great location. We have a family room which has a lounge area with a sofa bed and a separate bedroom, so perfect for our family of three. We will definitely be returning to this hotel next time we come to London!! - Very enjoyable stay."
"The Clermont, Victoria","Beautiful Hotel in a great location! This is a beautiful hotel! It has a lot of character and the rooms are immaculate and well-kept. It's also in agreat location, I would highly recommend it!  Note to management: I received a coin to use at the bar for a drink as a reward for using the company website. This would be a nice touch if you could redeem it for a regular cocktail, glass of wine, or a standard bar drink. impressive building located at Victoria station, so ideal for travelling around the city. Friendly, helpful staff and the rooms are of a very good standard. Would also  recommend the cocktail bar! - Beautiful Hotel! - Gorgeous hotel in a great location. - Nice hotel in perfect location. The Clermont, Victoria is close to Victoria Station. The rooms are very modern and the staff really helpful. The check in process is slow and awful. The front desk staff was not helpful at all when we asked if we could check in earlier than 3pm after an overnight flight. The Clermont Victoria is in the perfect location above the Victoria Station. Close to Buckingham Palace and Big Ben. The staff were friendly and helpful and remembered you and the conversations you had with them. The rooms were clean and well stocked. The bar makes a great espresso martini. The Clermont, Victoria is the best hotel at which we have stayed in London during many visits. Check in was fast and easy and our room was ready at 12 noon on the date of check in. The hotel offers complimentary water and soda in the mini-fridge as well as coffee and snacks that were replenished throughout our stay. The Christmas tree in the lobby gave it the perfect ambiance. Food at The Soak was awesome, particularly dim sum, and the drinks at Reunion were great. Location is great for transportation and a short walk to Buckingham Palace, St James Park, Westminster Abbey. The Tea Lounge is located on Clemort Street in London. The atmosphere of the lounge strikes a perfect balance between elegance and comfort. The highlight of my visit was definitely the afternoon tea selection. The sandwiches were exceptionally fresh, each bite offering a delightful mix of flavors and textures. The sweets, particularly the cakes and scones, were a bit of a letdown as they felt somewhat dry."
Travelodge London Central City Road,"Great value, useful Central London location, efficient staff. Check-in was efficient - quickly dealing with a corporate booking error - and room very clean. Bonus was Chelsea and Lara on the bar: quick to respond, happy to chat whilst sorting out food (large pizza) and a glass of wine. Location is great, hotel has flaws. smell of ammonia (means they cleaned) - elevators are tiny. smoke detector light was blinking, it was distracting at night. - windows are not soundproof, we heard conversations from the street. - interior doors are notSoundproof. Interior fire doors are narrow and difficult to navigate with large luggage. Sabbir is in an excellent location near to train station, bus stop, market and restaurant. New refurbished rooms are perfect for a short weekend break. Strong point: Excellent position and breakfast. Weak point: the cleaning of the camera was never done, every day you can change the towels. The hotel has been refurbished. Convenient location, with a bus stop in the door and two tube stations less than 10min walking. The bar and restaurant is poorly organized and in total confusion; but a special to Max for is availability to help us. Room cleaning and linen changes non-existent. Hotel is located in a quiet area of central London. Staff were friendly and welcoming. No wifi, no service  no inbetween cleaning or fresh towels. Rooms are small especially family rooms. Would not recommend this hotel for a family stay. Hotel is a good place to stay if you want to get away from London."
Royal National Hotel,"The room is clean and the bed is comfortable It's a good location It's close to the station. It's easy to move around The breakfast is delicious The staff are very friendly Vaishnawi (host) very kind Good! - One  time to wasteVery nosy place. No Aircon, but very hot because of central heating which you can't control. You can't open the window because of the noise!  Shower mixer very funny, takes 10min to adjust. In my opinion very expensive for what you get. For one night car pak is NOT included!  - Clean and well-located hotelFriendly staff and clean and well -located Hotel The City Sleeper hotel is located in the city center of London. The hotel is well located and the breakfast is nice. The customer service I received at the Royal Na was excellent. The concierge kindness is Top Notch. The room is pleasant with a bedding at the top! The couple who manage this hotel is very pleasant and attentive. Royal National Hotel was outstanding. The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Olga. We were given a superior room. All the details were top quality and new. The bathroom was clean and fully renovated, and the beds were so comfortable! It is very well located, only 2min from subway and bus station. Hotel was very quiet at all hours and in a great location very near tube stops and shops/restaurants. The breakfast is exceptional with quite a few selections; the dining staff are very attentive. Overall, it was a great experience and a hotel I would recommend. The rooms are not wheelchair accessible. We had to move to a non accessible room to access the room. The doors and doorsteps, they dont work for wheelchair users. In the room, the bathtub, its not good for handicapped with mobility issues either. The room is expensive for what it is: old, small and with a strange odor. We felt discriminated against. Nobody help us, they treated very very badly. I want to sue them through consumer protection. Royal National Hotel is located in the centre of the city. The hotel is in the perfect location for everything. The staff are friendly and friendly. The rooms are wide, clean and confortable. The food is good and the service is excellent. It was a pleasure to stay here!"
Strand Palace,"The Strand Palace is located in the West End of London. The hotel is a short walk from Covent Garden. The rooms are very clean and the facilities are very good. The location is very convenient, right next to Covent garden. The staff at the front desk were very friendly. Strand Palace is in a great location and the room was clean and comfortable. The staff are soooo amazing and friendly. The rooms are a little small but I’ve heard that’s to be expected in London. The breakfast is amazing. The hotel has very good services and is well located. Haxells at the Strand Palace is a great place to stay in Londen. The hotel has a lovely vibe with friendly and helpful staff. They even put balloons, a card and chocolates in the room to celebrate my daughter's birthday. The room itself was spacious, modern and well equipped. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here if/when we're in London again. The food was delicious and the drinks were perfect. The staff were extremely friendly and professional. The rooms are very spacious & the place is immaculate. Breakfast is Devine & a great selection on offer. The hotel is a great location for the westend of London. The Strand Palace is located on The Strand in the middle of theatre land. The staff at the restaurant and hotel are all super friendly and very attentive. The hotel is located in a very convenient area. The food was delicious as well. I would definitely recommend it to eat here. Jamitish and Hasan at the Reception were completely fantastic. They truly excel at customer service and must be commended. The hotel is in great condition, in an ideal neighborhood with great rooms and lovely restaurant. We would definitely stay again. -  Superb Stay"
The Piccadilly London West End,"Staff were incredibly helpful and attentive. Great location too. Staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was 5 star. Room was so small we had no space to put our small suitcases. It was like a box room. The bed was the smallest double bed I have ever stayed in. The hotel is very - DONT stay here if you want to sleep. The Piccadilly is a great hotel in a great location. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff are very helpful. The bar area is cramped and the restaurant is more of a cafe style. Finally the rooms  ARE NOT sound proof! So forget sleeping all we could hear was police sirens and car alarms going off all night. The hotel is located in the heart of SoHo, London's West End. The hotel has a spa, a restaurant and is close to the theatre. The staff are friendly and the rooms are very comfortable. However, the Wi-Fi is shocking and the hotel does not have a shower gel. The hotel is centrally located allowing you to walk to many locations (theater, shopping, British Museum, Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, etc.) The closest that I have to a complaint is that there is no grab bar in the shower. It was a very big step in and out of the tub to bathe. The Picadilly is in SoHo, London High Street; the shopping, theater and fine dining district. The hotel is clean and modern and stocked with everything a guest may need. The staff are completely focused on their guests and deliver exceptional service. The rooms are well furnished and maintained to a very high standard. Theatreland is a hidden gem in the middle of Theatreland. Staff were so friendly and helpful, went the extra mile to make sure my mum had a lovely birthday. Hotel was in a great location and room was lovely. Will definitely be visiting again on our next trip to London. , great location. Perfect for a city trip, hotel located close to everything. And the breakfast is really worth it!  - Memorable London stay. Highly recommend this hotel, they made our stay very special. It was my Mum's birthday trip, we had a show to see and the hotel was ideally located."
The Gate,"The Gate Hotel London is a great choice for those looking for modern, comfort, convenience and service. The building is very nice, very modern and very clean. The rooms and suites and one bedroom apartments are all extremely small, surprising for a newer structure in London. The sofa bed is very comfortable, but there are no king size beds, just doubles. The Gate is on the corner of a busy road just like the Wilde. The rooms were beautifully decorated, quite unique bathrooms and had a very - Comfortable modern studio accommodation. The service was excellent; rooms a decent size; quality bedding although double beds are slightly on the small size. Will definitely be staying here again. The Gate is a great value for money. The hotel is close to Brick Lane and Liverpool street station. The price you pay does not equate to the quality you get. We paid £451 for two nights including breakfast, in one of the studio apartments; compared to other hotels I’ve stayed in for similar prices, in London, I felt the room left a lot to be desired. The Gate Hotel London boasts a strong collection of 189 apartment bedrooms. Despite its busy location, The Gate provides an atmosphere of serenity, plus a very warm welcome. The hotel has excellent transport links and is walking distance from City business hubs, plus popular locations such as Tower Bridge, Brick Lane, and Shoreditch. The Gate is a great choice of hotel for a business trip. The rooms are so much better than a hotel. The lounge in the fifth floor is a modern and relaxing place to gather before or after dinner. The studio I’ve stayed in had everything I needed and was kept very clean. The Gate London Hotel provides a memorable and comfortable stay in the heart of London. The impeccable service, stylish accommodations, and excellent dining options make it a top choice for travelers looking to experience the best of the city. The area where the hotel is located is perfect and close to the universities. The lounge on the 5th floor is great to gran a cup of coffee or get work done."
"Holiday Inn London - West, an IHG Hotel","Holiday Inn London West is a great place to stay in London. The staff are friendly and friendly, and the restaurant meals are amazing. The hotel has a great location and is close to many train stations. However, the bar area is full of flies and there are no limes or lemons in the glasses. The hotel is very conveniently located between North Acton station of Central Line and Acton Main Line station of Elizabeth line (quick Heathrow connect). Front desk stuff professional and polite. Room (premium king) was great. Large for London standards with a great fluffy bed and all the basics you may need during your stay. The Holiday Inn West in Acton (a western suburb of London) is a cut above most Holiday Inns - it has a restaurant and a bar. The food in the evening was amazing. The Capao stir fry is a must try. The reception staff were fantastic and did all that they could to get me the best rate. The rooms were fine for a 2 night stay, the roof terrace was somewhere quiet to escape to for a little while out of the room and bar. Breakfast was good not great full English again good Limited on choice, but was sufficient to set you up for the day. The hotel is convenient and handy because it is in a good location with ease of access to North Acton Underground station. Parking is easy if you arrive  early, but if you’re coming a bit later, spaces may be hard to come by. The staff were very polite and accommodating; and Linoska stood out in particular. Hotel is wonderful and the staff are amazing! The breakfast in the restaurant is delicious, but what makes it even better is the warm welcome and sweet smile you receive from Miss Violeta each morning as you come to breakfast. It is close to public transportation as well which is a bonus!! - Well-priced base to explore London. Location is perfect...just a 5 mins walk from the North Acton tube station. Nice spacious room and good breakfast on the offer. The hotel staff especially the full F&B team was super and so so helpful. The only thing I struggled was to get -  a room with two beds."
Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,"Park Plaza is a great hotel for business stays in central London. The staff were excellent and helpful when we needed to store our bags for the day and get a taxi for our next location. The sushi at Ishi was delicious. The concierge Hassan made the difference during our days in London. Habib was amazing and the best server we had!! He was so polite and super friendly!! We stayed at the Radisson in mid January and were here for a sisters trip. He made our stay more enjoyable and always had a smile on his face. We really enjoyed our stay here. It is very expensive but we did like it. Park Plaza, Westminster Bridge is in great location and walking distance to many good restaurants and places. The rooms are a good size, the studio rooms in particular are lovely. The gym and pool are also of a high quality and a great way to relax after a long day. Park Plaza Westminster is a great hotel for families. The location is great, just across the bridge from Westminster Abbey/Elizabeth Tower with Big Ben. The food is amazing and the staff are friendly and welcoming. The hotel is located near the bridge just few steps to Big Ben and the London Eye. The Park Plaza London has become our favorite premium hotel. The rooms were clean and well attended to & everyone we encountered was wonderful. The view of the Big Ben and the London Eye is perfect. The bar itself is beautiful and very relaxing. The service was quick and efficient. Park Plaza Westminster Hotel is located in central London. The hotel is one of the most popular hotels in the capital. The rooms are spotless with great pillows and bedding and big, fluffy towels - and lot of them. The Guest Services staff is amazing at responding to both simple and complex challenges with a smile and positive  “can do” attitude."
ibis London Canning Town,"Ibis London Canning Town Hotel is just a cross the road by underground train. The rooms are clean and modern with a great bathroom. The bar/cafe downstairs was also really good with great pizzas! - Amazing!Ibis @ Ca. is a very nice hotel with very friendly staff. Curtis is the best!!  great place to stay for The 02, easy to use the tube opposite   GREAT BREAKFAST!!  a little noisy at night with emergery sirens but out of control for hotel. Located near to O2 arena and North Greenwich and the Jubilee line connects you quickly to the city. The Ibis in Canning Town is a short journey from the O2 Arena. The hotel is just across the road from a London Undergrat. The breakfast is self service, continental and cooked. The Jubilee line is one stop away from the 02. The car is a 10 mins walk from the hotel and it takes you across the Thames. The hotel is just across the street from the DLR and Tube Station. The rooms are well appointed, comfortable. The beds in the twin room are very narrow and not that comfortable (for me anyway). The election of drinks at the bar isn’t very extensive and are a bit pricey. The hotel is just across a train station so traveling was very convincing! They have a nice ambiance downstairs at the lobby where you can enjoy drinks! Also bot to forget the lavish breakfast they serve! All in all a very good hotel! - DisappointingMy second stay in this hotel and second review (first on the hotel site) First stay was 6 months ago and my rating was 5+. But now my rating is 2. Customer service at this Ibis is exceptional. Curtis in particular made me fell like a member of the family. Food good - can recommend the pizza and the breakfasts. Comfy room. Very clean.  I also love the robot vacuums. - An unexpected treatOrganising an event in excel and ibis excel fully booked. Ended up in Canning Town. Incomparably better. Lovely room. Great vibes in the bar. Cracking breakfast. Brilliant service and staff. Highly recommend if you're visiting London. - Nice Hotel for a business trip. hey couldn't do enough to help us, from taking a photo of us all before the wedding to calling taxis when it started to rain. Very convenient for all transport links. Highly recommended. -  ""The Wedding"" is on Channel 4, Channel 5, Channel 6, Channel 7 and Channel 8."
Palmers Lodge Swiss Cottage,"The room was great! Very clean! The pillows were great! Soft and pliable, not too full or hard. The location was nice and the neighborhood was cute. The showers on the top floor are the cleanest by far. We would definitely stay there again. Location is perfect less than 20min to Westminister via Jubilee line. The lounge is absolutely beautiful, especially with the Christmas decorations up. The bar/breakfast area is very trendy, and plenty of room for everyone. The breakfast is great value, £6.50 for a continental. Location is ideal for going to central London. Staff are lovely and friendly. It is quite a large hostel though and it only has two washing machines -one of which is a full-size. It's equipt with everything you might need for a comfortable stay, and even if you forgot something, you can rent it, or buy it, for a very low price. The hostel is really nice, I felt safe and it looked clean. The location is also nice like it’s not the best place in London but it's still a very good location. The lockers are also not big enough and there was a lot of luggage strewn about the dorm room. No male bathroom on the second floor was frustrating. The hostel is in a beautiful old building, and an excellent location to access central London quickly. The price was very reasonable (for London) - I paid £100 per night for a private twin ensuite. The only downside for me was that all the staff I interacted with seemed pretty unfriendly. The hostel is built in an old, impressive building and they did very well at adjusting the features to the house. The furnishing is really stylish. Not too crowded at the moment and good value for money. No AC, no fans, zero airflow. Just a room of 10 people breathing and making it SO HOT you cannot sleep."
Novotel London Blackfriars,"Felt unsafe and they have not taken the issue seriously. Locked door when went to bed. At 5.55am someone used a keycard and entered the room, overriding the lock, suggesting it was a member of staff. 40 minute wait for food. Staff were seen just standing around, looking board, and looking like they would like to be somewhere else. The hotel is ideally situated next to Southwark tube station (2 minute walk) The staff we encountered were all fantastic and friendly. We found the room small for the price, not very spacious for a family room, sharing with our daughter. The highlight for our daughter the hotel has a pancake machine that allows you to make your own pancakes. Staff were excellent and efficient but the standard and presentation of the hotel needs some attention. The buffet breakfast we found  was very average in choice and presentation. The location is perfect for London sightseeing, you have access to the subway just down the road. The Thames is a 5 min walk away where you can stroll or hop on a ferry. The rooms were clean with the most beautiful view looking out over Shard especially of a night, it was breathtaking. Food was lovely for breakfast (especially the pancakes) We had the loveliest of wait staff looking after us. Will definitely be back. The hotel's staff exemplify outstanding hospitality, and I would highly recommend this establishment. Novotel London Blackriars is centrally located to several'must see' attractions with tube stations very close and around 20 minute walk to London Eye and Tower Bridge. The staff are exceptional from reception to housekeeping and the buffet breakfast is simply one of the best I have ever had anywhere with lots of options. The hotel is very central in the city. You can walk to both London eye, Big Ben and Tower Bridge. The rooms are clean and there is pool in the basement (remember to book). We experienced several time long queues in the reception. The only reason I gave this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the bathroom. The rooms were wonderful, big and cozy. The minibar was full of room (in which the staff put free bottles of water and sparkling water). The pool was great. The breakfast had a large variety of foods (plus a cool pancake machine) The location is convenient to Southwark subway and it’s a 15-20 walk to ‘Borough markets and many other attractions on the south of the river."
St. Athans Hotel,"St Athans is located between London Euston and Russel Square Tube stations. Great value for money and a great location in the heart of London. No lift and lots of stairs, no tea / coffee, no breakfast and small rooms. Basic and small but clean and comfortable - essential to read up front hotel info. St. Athans is a great hotel for travelers on a budget. The rooms are small but for the price, it is just right. The hotel is not wheelchair accessible at all whatsoever. The bathroom barely fits one person, and the hotel isn't wheelchair accessible. The reception office is treasure trove of travel artifacts. St Athans hotel is in a great location with good public transport links nearby (Euston station is a short walk) The room was comfortable and spotlessly clean. The shared bathrooms were well maintained and clean. Although the room was small, considreing the very competitive price and its location, I was more than satisfied with that. The toilet was filthy on arrival and clearly not cleaned throughout the day/night. The shower was hot but the tray was blocked so feet were swimming in the water. The bed, whilst small, was reasonably comfortable. There is no TV in the room or tea/coffee making facilities. - Highly recommend this friendly and lovely hotel! St Athans Hotel is located near Russell Square tube station. The rooms are not clean under the bed there's dust and plastic leftover from some other guest. No elevators available, so ask for a ground floor room if you're mobility-impaired or have heavy luggage. Bathroom located outside the room, but private. St. Athans Hotel is a great place to stay in an excellent location with lovely staff. Close to Kings Cross, St Pancras and Euston and lots of underground stations, making it easy to visit anywhere you want to visit. Fantastic friendly hotel in a brilliant location. Spotlessly clean and helpful lovely staff - Treated Like Family. Covid is a top-class hotel in central London. Staff are very friendly and make you feel like you're really welcome. Room was basic in some ways but for the good price I could not complain about my stay here. 12 minutes away from King cross station."
Margaritaville Resort Times Square,"Margaritaville Resort Times Square is a tropical enclave that brings a beach vibe to the heart of Manhattan. The property features 234 rooms, 5 restaurant and bars, a year round outdoor heated pool, a fitness centre and a retail store. It is a hop-skip-and-a-jump from attractions the likes of Broadway, Central Park and the Empire State Building. The hotel and rooms were decorated like a beach resort. Our room cannot see Times Square but had good view of - Great stay. The rooms are brightly lit, like new, and very clean. The margaritaville adds the real resort feel. Each bar/ restaurant has it's own experience. The rooms are on the small side but  once you use the space in the rooms then you will be fine. Cleaning was done every day and we had a coffee machine and fridge available. There is a beautiful terrace with a swimming pool and a small shop selling very nice gadgets. The staff at street level are there to greet you and will direct you to the elevator. The rooms are small but cleverly designed to provide good service. The housekeeping staff cleans the rooms daily and does a wonderful job. The facility is convenient and the view is excellent. The hotel was impeccably clean and the staff provided exceptional service. The rooms are kinda small but the linens are great. The elevators are a nightmare when they are even functional. The mini-Starbucks in the lobby, not open mid-day, you can’t even buy a water. Staff was excellent. The rooms were also very clean and equipped with a large TV. The location is ideal for tourists, as many landmarks are within walking distance. The lobby is not located right at the entrance; you need to take an elevator to reach it. Despite being advertised as a resort, it falls short of the expectations of someone who frequents resorts. Gem Hotel in the middle of Times Square is an amazing choice to stay. The rooms are spacious and beds are sooo comfortable! Would recommend family and friends!! Will and Ismar were a great help with all our requests during our stay! We can’t wait to come back!!"
Moxy NYC Times Square,"Moxy Times Square always accommodates your needs. The bar on the second floor is awesome if you want to chill and enjoy some beverage, food and music. The magic hour is just a spot you must go to fell what a party in NYC truly is. - NYC at the Moxy is the best! The Moxy has a definite vibe; think shabby chic loft. It's not bad, just not great for what you pay. Stay away unless you're looking for a cheap no frills crash pad. If you are a Marriott member, I d d d upgraded me (for free!) to a massive suite! Location, location, location and great customer service are all positives. Cons: Poor, poor customer service; we were told conflicting things by multiple staff. Were not told where the lobby was to wait for a room. Staff from top to bottom treated us poorly.o not recommend this hotel. It will be a poor use of points. The hotel is beautiful and relaxing. You must stay here when visiting New York!!!  - Amazing experience; Melany was a HIT. Neat and tidy hotel & room.   Also, and more important: Melany, the front desk clerk, was OUTSTANDING. Moxy Times Square is in a great location in Times Square. The rooms are small but we were out n about during the day. Out of the 3 queen with a loft bedrooms we had booked our room was slightly larger than the other 2 rooms and this was definitely better. The vibe was young and awesome. The Moxy is a great hotel. The staff was top notch. The room was clean and comfortable. The shower was amazing. The team was awesome. The hotel was clean. It was a great location to everything in the city!   - Great staff, cool vibe."
The Plaza New York - A Fairmont Managed Hotel,"Tea at Palm Court was such a wonderful experience. Great service, beautiful atmosphere, and delicious scones and pastries. Shalim, our server made my daughter’s birthday so special by bringing out a piece of chocolate mousse cake and singing to her! - Best Breakfast I’ve Ever HadThis is the type of experience money can’t buy. It is worth every penny, and even more. The food and tea was delicious but the experience was truly made by the service provided by Fariz. Fariz went out of his way to ensure that the 4 of us had a delightful experience. Porfirio Cortes was a wonderful waiter who made our afternoon tea very so enjoyable. The ambiance is worth it alone, but the food and tea are also EXQUISITE!  Cannot wait to go back again. Don’t have the High Tea at The Plaza.AVOID the high tea at all costs. Unless a tower of stale, low quality cakes and  sandwiches for $692 is your thing (family of 4), then go right ahead. The food was delicious, the tea was hot, the Bellinis were decadent. The staff were really lovely and helpful especially Khalid Chowdhury. I would definitely go again. - Tea at the plazaFadiz was our server for tea at the Plaza and he was the most kind, wonderful, and friendly person. The Plaza has iconic status in New York and therefore doesn't have to try very hard to attract guests. Unfortunately the hotel owners have taken full advantage of that reputation and stopped trying many years ago and as a result the Plaza is extremely dated. Fixtures, fittings, decor and general upkeep have not been attended to for decades and the absence of any investment is both obvious and shocking."
"Homewood Suites by Hilton New York/Midtown Manhattan Times Square-South, NY","The Homewood Suites Hilton on 37th St. is in the perfect location if you are going to MSG. The staff was friendly, helpful, and went beyond the call of duty whenever asked. The breakfast was bountiful and delicious and the staff were friendly and efficient. The room was clean and comfortable. The hotel is a great location for families to explore the city as it is walking distance to many of the main attractions and Penn Station is only a short walk away. Breakfast had many hot and cold options and even supplied 'take out' boxes to fill up if you wanted to take anything extra for the day. Booking.com didn't check us in straight away as they spent one hour thirty minutes trying to figure out if we made payment. They only managed to give me one room I paid for and issued a lower grade room as the second room. On checking out they tried to charge my card which I asked them shouldn’t it be them refunding me the $100 they took during check in. Hot beverages available 24/7 in the hotel reception area. Great location near Madison Square Garden and other touristic sights. Kitchenette in the room was very useful and it was pretty quiet given the location, which may have been because we were on a high floor. Free breakfast was a bonus too! Homewood Suites NYC is a great location for sight seeing and subway travel. The rooms are big for New York City standards, but the sofa bed could be better. The location is great, easy to get around and the staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel has great facilities and it’s more convenient for tourist like me. Homewood Suites Midtown/Times Square is located close to both Herald Square and Times Square. Great location on a quite block 8th/37th. Wednesday evening cocoa and hot soup reception. Customer Service: The ENTIRE staff from check in to check out (shout out to Juan)"
Motto by Hilton New York City Chelsea,"Motto is located in the heart of Manhattan, between 6th and 7th Ave. Nearest subway at 23rd street just 1 block away too with various uptown and downtown routes. The 42nd floor view gives vista across Lower Manhatton. Free Wi-Fi worked everywhere in the hotel and rooms and premises were immaculately clean. Motto was an outstanding choice for our long weekend in NY over Thanksgiving. Our stunning view of lower Manhattan from the 42nd floor morning and night was the ultimate start and end to each day. Housekeeping was fully on point and diligent although the h/k staff kept forgetting to leave a spare toilet roll (biggest complaint which is nothing I know) The view really made the stay and the trip for us! Rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated, though very small by US standards. Main drawbacks for us was the destination fee - $30 a night with $10 credit to use in the hotel restaurant. Staff were friendly but not all that efficient for an older couple. The food is fantastic, the cocktails divine...10/10 would absolutely recommend!  - Great hotel in a wonderful location. The rooms are small, but we had a great room on the 36th floor. The only downsides are: no coffee/tea in the room, no refrigerator, and the shower lost all hot water a couple times. Motto by Hilton New York City Chealsea is located in the heart of New York (NY) United State.room rates $155  per night (USD) price match... ChealseA is a great area to stay. It is so Central everything. It's near the meatpackingdistrict. With fantastic dining options. And is close to greenwhich village. The hotel is a 3-mile walk to Central Park and NBC studios. The food, service and range of drinks available is great. The views from the room are quite possibly the best in NY. The rooms are incredibly comfortable and have everything you require including a super comfy bed. The best part of Motto is Lulla! The hotel was amazing. Tons to do in the surrounding area!  We did a good tour, ate at some great restaurants, went in the summit and even a ghost tour. The drinks/food were pricey and we’d have gone elsewhere had we not received a $10 food voucher. The hotel were fair with their compensation following the 2 fire alarms. The view.. is just breathetaking!! 38th floor. Clean and neat room. Perfect place to stay. whenever come back to New York, will stay in Motto surely. - It was fine in general however it's not a 5-star residence. Didn’t get a decent sleep in 5 nights."
Arlo SoHo,"The hotel was immaculately clean and in a safe and accessible area. The staff was AMAZING. Edwyn and Ivan were particularly helpful with bag storage. The rosemary mescal margarita was totally original,  smokey, herbal and subtly sweet. The hotel is gorgeous, very clean, the bed is very comfortable, and all the staff (especially Alejandro) were superb. We really enjoyed spending time at the speakeasy bar, and the bodega was great for early morning coffees. The Arlo Soho is in a great location with some fabulous bars and restaurants to explore. The Arlo SoHo hotel is a great place to stay for a romantic getaway. The front desk staff are all amazing, but especially Edwyn, Danny, and Ivan. The service in Bodega was 2nd to none. The team are fantastic. Rooms comfortable and clean. The staff at the Arlo are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are quiet. Lighting and outlets are good. Hotel is close to two subway stops on Canal St. Lots of good restaurants close by. The location is wonderful, right by Soho and the train. However, the best part of this hotel is the staff; their customer service is superb. Arlo SoHo Hotel achieves excellence, thanks to standout staff members Ivan, Danny, and Alejandro. Ivan's seamless check-ins set a positive tone, while Danny's dedication and recommendations enhance the guest experience. Alejandro's exceptional service, from personalized assistance to genuine hospitality, adds a memorable touch. n was there to help me bring up my luggage to my room, then he recommended 3 great restaurants,  and he also helped me organize transportation to the airport. He's truly amazing! -  -       -      –  "
The Bryant Park Hotel,"The Bryant Park Hotel is my favorite place to stay in NYC. The rooms are comfortable and well-furnished. The location is ideal in mid-town. The front desk team who helped us was amazing the entire time and Jo was incredible. The hotel is beautiful, and the rooms are so spacious and bright. The Bryant Park Hotel is located just off 5th avenue and in the heart of midtown New York. The rooms are great, as are the bar and restaurant. The location is phenomenal. The hotel bar is very nicely set up and the restaurant had good quality food. The hotel is located right at the heart of 6th Ave at 40 St which s perfect for all major attractions. The staff were friendly and the room was spacious and clean. The location was so perfect for everything we needed to do. Just a quick walk to the Museum of Modern Art, Central Park and plenty of shopping and restaurants. The BPH is the best hotel in NYC. The rooms are clean and very spacious. The location is perfect regardless the time of year you are visiting. The staff are the nicest, caring, helpful people you will ever meet. The restaurant and bar were closed on Christmas day so we didn't get to try those. The Bryant Park Hotel is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel is centrally located for the Christmas Markets and Skating Rink, The NY Public Library etc. The staff were superb during our stay and particularly wanted to thank Larry Houseman who helped us our last evening with food. The Bryant Park Hotel is excellent, its location is perfect, adjacent to Bryant Park, excellent location, between 5th and 6th avenues, in the center of the city and the entertainment center. The hotel is in fantastic situation for a tourists holiday - central for everything - this place has it all! Bryant Park Hotel is in the best location for a holiday visit. You can walk to everything including having the Winter Village right across the street. The front desk staff made our birthday extra special with hand signed cards, balloon and a bottle of Prosecco. The room and hotel itself could use some updating and repairs. The Bryant Park Hotel is in the best location on Bryant Park. Rooms were larger than normal for New York. The downstairs bar had a great vibe to it. We will definitely return to The Bryant Park Hospitality. -  ""Fantastic hotel and in thebest location on Bryant Park"""
Pod Times Square,"The room is small and basic as it is low budget, but you get everything you need. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The location is fantastic: right beside multiple restaurants, a corner store, and within walking distance to iconic spots like Rockefeller Center and popular shopping spots (Nintendo store, Hershey store, Disney store)  Pod Times Square is a great location for walking to either the Javits Convention Center or Times Square. The staff is also so accommodating. The room was clean, comfortable and had everything I needed. The location is awesome, and overall I`m never dissapointed by this hotel. The room was comfortable for such a small space. Daily room service never happened, even when requested. The overall experience with employees and cleaning was good. The room was OK, but it really is a sardine can. Don't expect any frills. The staff was super friendly and efficient. The restaurant staff was also super friendly. The rooms are good and the staff are friendly and accommodating. The location is perfect as starting point to go everywhere, but a little noisy even when the window is closed. The bathroom and shower are gorgeous but the room is not properly clean. The shower was nice with built in shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The Pod Times Square is a good hotel for the price. The rooms are small but clean and the location is central to everything. The beds are somewhat uncomfortable, putting in requests for no housekeeping and still experiencing attempts for housekeeping (no, there was no door sign to put up), and for a confirmed late checkout to be ignored. The beds were horribly hard on our backs and the pillows were rice paper thin. The shower is very slippery, falls definitely a possibility. Only, I mean only positive was the location. Never again. Recommend 10/10 - Only only positive is location.  -  -"
Tempo by Hilton New York Times Square,"The rooms are a bit small but they make the most of the limited space and they were very clean. The drinks were well made and the wings and breakfast foods were delicious. The bar is a bit expensive but that was to be expected. The entire staff was warm,bubbly and friendly, even my business partner was exceptionally pleased. The staff is absolutely incompetent. We booked and paid on 15th November (1.5 months in advance) for the corner room with the New year Ball view. The price for this view for 1 night is more than 2000 USD. The front desk personnel were rude to anyone who asked for an update on when the room would be ready. Tempo NY Hilton Times Square is located in prime Times Square location. Hotel has a great bar and is centrally located in the heart of the city. Hotel is located near Times Square and is close to the New York Times Square subway station. The hotel has a beautiful lobby which gave us a big lift from our damped spirits. The Tempo is right in the middle of Times Square. The rooms are very small for high prices. The food is great, hotel is gorgeous, and the staff are super friendly. The only downside to my stay was on arrival at the airport to depart, when checking out of the room and asking to leave my bags in reception. Tempo is located right in the heart of Times Square, on 47th and Broadway. Location is perfect, close to major attractions that are all within walking distance. Staff were friendly and so helpful, and understanding to our every need. The wifi is not premium high speed at all, so - Best hotel experience ever! The hotel was fantastic. David, with the Bell Team, was phenomenal. He let us know exactly when we needed to head out for our flight. He had a car waiting for us and quoted us a fair fare, less than Uber. The only feedback I have for the hotel is provide your guests with access to water in every room. The other thing is definitely not enough staff at the chec Hotel is hip, classy and ultra comfy. Great charisma and charm - hotel was an amazing stay!  - Tempo is the best!! Every staff member is so happy to see you all the time. The location is impeccable with amazing views and even better customer service."
Pod 51 Hotel,"The rooms are a little small but very very clean and basic. The beds are comfy, warm and the pillows are dreamy! Bathroom is clean and all we needed. The window into the bathroom is odd, and you do have to avoid accidentally seeing through to whoever is using the toilet. The room was about the size of an oversized closet. The hot water was extremely and dangerously hot. The mattresses were too firm for all of us. The Pod we stayed in was in a separate brownstone walk up. The manager's attitude was rude and unhelpful. The Pod 51 is located very centralised and the staff were very kind. The rooms were small and the bathrooms were communal but everything was clean and accommodating. The only negative were pillows were basic and the private bathroom was tiny. All in all would stay again.  - Dirty rooms with cockroaches - do not stay there. Location is amazing, Radio City, Time Square, Central Park and many other things are walkable, or easy with the subway. Rooms are quite small, perfect for solo travellers. Location is good if you want to walk around the    location. Staff was very friendly and helpful though.  Pod51 is a small hotel in Manhattan, New York City. The rooms are small, but the value of the hotel is excellent. The hotel is close to 5th avenue and central park and felt safe. The room was dark and very noisy, and the heating was not turned up."
Hotel Riu Plaza New York Times Square,"Riu Plaza is located in the heart of Times Square. Staff are excellent very polite and always happy to help. The hotel is well located and a quick walk to Times Square and various subway lines. Hotel is stunning and very clean. The breakfast buffet had an am am am breakfast buffet. The RIU plaza times square is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel is located near the theater, restaurants and markets. The view from the hotel is terrible and the bed has no comforter. The free breakfast is a joke, we are crammed like sardines. The hotel is in a great location, close to restaurants, bars and Times Square. The rooms are a little on the small side but everything you need in a room. Although no tea/coffee making facilities. The bar staff were not at all friendly just rude and would not encourage you to sit there and have a drink. The most amazing hotel in the best location. Central to times square 10/10 and only a short walk to everything. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms good size. Breakfast was fab.  Bar and coffee bar attached also good - Riu review 0/10. The hotel itself was extremely clean and the staff were so polite. Location is excellent with plenty to do within walking distance. Room was comfortable with a good mattress, unfortunately New York never sleeps so expect some noise in the night/early hours. Breakfast buffet included in the package and has a generous selection of hot or cold food as well as cereal and fruit. Hotel Riu is located right on doorstep of Times Square. Staff are friendly, courteous and professional. Rooms are premier inn standard but half the size. Hotel is convenient near restaurants, public transportation, major Broadway theaters and walking distance from Rockefeller Center and Central Park. Hotel is located in between Times Square and Hells kitchen - so food and shopping covered! Hotel also has a cafe open until 9:30 pm for a nice cuppa and snack if you fancy. Hotel has a bar that closes later and a great location."
Park Central Hotel New York,"The Park Central Hotel offers spacious, light-filled rooms with luxurious bedding. The hotel staff is friendly and attentive to the needs of the guests. The elevator system is broken and guests are advised to use the service elevator while it is being repaired. The subway is the best deal in town and easy to use. The hotel is close to the center of New York City and is within walking distance to Times Square. The room was exceptionally clean, spacious for a city hotel with good amenities. The only complaint about this is the elevators, as there is a long wait every time to use them. Location was brilliant, close to Central Park, Times Square, Hell’s Kitchen etc! Staff are super friendly, welcoming and helpful. WiFi is good and included. Taxi availability was brilliant for leaving for the airport they are all lined up outside. Price was very reasonable for NYC  - luggage storage was secure and great to use. Park Central Hotel is located on 7th Avenue between Central Park and Times Square. The hotel is located in a great location not to far from things but quite enough to sleep at night, staff polite and alway willing to help. The elevators are a disaster! - Good locations, but significant issues. The hotel is in a great location, a short walk from everything and with numerous delis nearby. The staff were so friendly ( especially the bar staff ) and the room was clean and had the nice hotel smell. The only criticisms were that is was very poorly lit and there was no coffee machine. The Moma is located in a great location and is a short walk from the city centre. However, the hotel has a number of problems, including a lack of lifts. The hotel also has problems with the check in process and the staff are rude and condescending. To avoid - WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. AVOID AT ALL COST. Park Central Hotel was by New York standards very modern inside, very pleasantly surprised by the decor, good food and service, very clean and the location was amazing. The hotel rooms are clean but worn, light switch was hanging off, doors delaminating, carpet shrunk, bath plug didn't work etc. Beds were extremely comfortable however and on the 17th floor we had a semi decent view of the front. The rooms were mildly clean but the air conditioning didn't work and the rooms get very stuffy and hot. The lounge and its food restrictions wasn't guest friendly, most of the days it was roped off for Turkish Airlines. The mattresses are old (could feel springs) so even after a room change the issue remained. The same elevator that was out of service 2 years ago is still down."
Hyatt Grand Central New York,"The hotel is located in the Grand Central station building. The rooms are nice and modern with good but small bathrooms. The gym is located on the top floor and has a good selection of equipment and weights. On the 16th floor is the Commendore study, which is a blend of an executive lounge and a co-working space. Hotel is situated next to Grand Central Station and is the perfect location for seeing New York. Transport options are easily accessible (Train, Bus, Taxi or Uber) and if you like walking as we did we walked for miles. Good location staff on the door 24 / 7 so really safe. The hotel is not clean and has almost no amenities. The rooms do not include some necessities like toothbrushes. The hotel is old, run down and overall not nice to stay at. The 15$ voucher each day you would think to be a nice perk. Except when you see the cho.y at a time when I was doing some shopping near the hotel. Hotel is located next to the Grand Central Station, so it is easy moving in the city. Room are clean but the bed was small and the bathroom vanity and toilet need to be replace. Food in the market was nice (although pricey but everything is in the tourist areas of New York) Location is fantastic, walking distance to a number of sites including Time Sq, 5th Ave, Rockafeller etc. Services within the hotel was poor, lack of towels in room, rooms not cleaned. Staff was very rude the rooms are dated. I for one will never stay at a Hyatt again. The hotel is in a great location, just a few blocks from Central Park. Staff were rude and unhelpful. The $35 snacks and drinks was at best average with no variety. Not a hotel I would recommend if you have a special event planned. The destination fee is a scam. The rooms are average, but the cleanliness and furniture are excellent."
Moxy NYC East Village,"Hooray! Best ever! Love it! Hooray!! This hotel is awesome. Great beds. The light switches could be less confusing but maybe it’s because I am old and sometimes stoned. What a concierge! Everything I imagined. Thanks! - Fabulous and Fun. - Moxy East Village does not disappoint! The Moxy has a great vibe and interesting decor. Head of security is the best Moxy employee. The coffee shop and bar are great hang outs. The staff here are great and really helpful. The coffeeshop in The Moxy East Village is a perfect place to get a good cup of coffee. The Moxy has the best staff in NYC. The rooms were efficient but well appointed. The shower water pressure was like no other. The staff was very kind and attentive. For a family that wakes at different times having a quality cafe on premises was perfect. The pastries weee fresh and moist with flavor. The Moxy East Village is a great location between the East Village & Union Square. The bar downstairs is a fantastic space to hang out in, it feels like an extended living room. The rooms are efficient, though we had a bit of trouble with the blinds. The beds were comfortable, - Thanks Carmen and team!!! The Moxy East Village is located in New York's East Village. The hotel is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The Moxy is a five-star hotel with a rooftop pool. The rooms are very clean and well looked after. The food is excellent and it was a perfect space for a meeting. East Village is a good location to stay when in Manhattan. Nikki on the front counter was awesome and very welcoming. We can't wait to visit again! - Trendy boutique hotelVery nice boutique hotel. Well appointed with trendy bar, cafe and sitting/socialising area."
The Knickerbocker,"The Knick is completely renovated, sleek and modern. Room service is very limited, but Charlie Palmers is very good. The rooftop is amazing. Location is convenient to most attractions. It is at times square near to my office. I enjoyed $50 credit for a nice breakfast at their cafe. I will go there again if I traveled to New York for work. The rooms were lovely, clean, comfortable and well furnished. Staff were very helpful. The rooftop terrace is lovely for a drink at night. The only thing I would change is providing coffee and tea facilities in the room as that would make a big difference in the mornings. The Knickerbocker is a classy gem in a perfect location with first class food and cocktails. The food from the restaurant was yummy and catered for a celiac. The room condition is really good, and the staff was VERY kind and excellent. The venue is completely beautiful and the service is so awesome!! I would absolutely recommend checking this hotel and rooftop out. The Knickerbocker is in the ‘Leading Hotels of the World’ group and markets itself as the only 5* hotel in Times Square. This is NOT a 5* standard hotel. The location is perfect for sightseeing. Housekeeping, the room was always immaculate on our return. The Knickerbocker is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel is close to Bryant Park, Grand Central station, Rockefeller Center, Empire State building and Joe's Pizza. The views from the roof top bar were spectacular. The rooms are very comfy and quiet, rooms are amazing."
Hotel Edison,"Hotel was near everything I wanted to be next to in the heart of Times Square. Loved the decor and service. Ice machine was next to my room and kept me up all night. Convenient onsite restaurants. Didn’t realize it was under construction till I got there.Perfect location for hotel, not for ice maker. Hotel Edison is a historical hotel, it is affordable, and it could not be situated in a more convenient part of Times Square. The rooms are very very clean and a great size compared to others near by. The Rum House offered great entertainment and bond 45 and friedmans offered great food!! Hotel Edison contributes to a great experience in Times Square. The hotel is on the affordable side, so the amenities were not necessarily a 'wow' factor, but the staff is very hospitable. The Grab & Go breakfast is a great option to bundle with the room! - Disappointing StayRoom changes and construction were a problem. Hotel Edison is in the heart of Time Square. The staff is amazing. The rooms are clean and updated. The only drawback of the hotel is its breakfast. It is not a buffet and doesn’t fill your stomach. It has deeply decreased our customer experience and will be the thing we will remember of this hotel. Location is exceptional. Staff is friendly and attentive. Breakfast vouchers are included as part of the nightly $40 fee, but I feel the charge is too high. Rooms are very clean and staff are very friendly especially Michelle (J) who was very helpful and gave us tips on where to go visit. Hotel Edison is located in the heart of the theater district. The rooms are very nicely appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff is friendly and extremely professional. The location is great for us as we was right next to everything - The Fabulous Hotel Edison!"
Ace Hotel New York,"Friendly staff, comfortable room. Slept like a baby in shear comfort. Clean-space- enjoyable- friendly front desk-non hassle. Great bed- soft pillows- great water pressure- lovely bath products. Safe hotel- ideal location- what’s not to love. The lobby at the Ace is very beautiful- lovely lighting & lots of cozy places to sit. The rooms had less amenities than our beloved Ace DTLA, but we were glad for the feather pillows & other trappings of familiarity that we love about The Ace. We had a perfect stay at the hotel. The location is great, everything was within walking distance from shops, to restaurants, to landmarks and the subway. Ace Hotel is in a very convenient area of Manhattan and rooms are large for NYC hotels. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was clean and a good size. Close to Penn station, it’s a great spot especially to stay away from Times Square  - Nice hotel in heart of midtown. The Ace Hotel New York offers a vibrant and trendy stay in the heart of the city. The industrial-chic decor, combined with attentive staff, creates a unique and inviting atmosphere. The rooms are well-designed with a mix of modern amenities and artistic touches. The on-site dining options and bar provide great culinary experiences. The Ace Hotel is in central New York City. The rooms are dark, small and not practical. The staff are friendly and the lobby is eclectic and charming. The location is great, but the rooms are not. The hotel is overpriced and the beds are not comfortable. Ace Hotel New York is located in a great neighborhood, surrounded by great places to eat and ease to get all over the city by subway. The staff is awesome and the rooms are clean and quiet. As always, no mistakes here. The room carries all you needs The lobby makes you liveable and young The location is perfect to go anywhere in the city. The decor is funky rooms. Up graded rooms and original artwork, fridges and turntables. The rooms are fully air conditioned. Fully accomodating staff. Neat and clean sorroundings. And also the restaurant  is so accessible and presentable."
"The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel","Location was great, the neighborhood was nice and lively, the hotel was only a few minute walk to the train station. The Tick Tock diner in the lobby was awesome for breakfast or a snack at the end of the day (try the Nutella and banana French toast; your taste buds will thank you) The rooms are a bit dated, but immaculately clean and very comfortable. The New Yorker Hotel is located in central New York City. It is in walking distance to Time Square, Broadway, Macy's, Bryant Park, Hudson Yards, Rockefeller Square, Empire State Building. The hotel is also right across the street from Penn Station which is great for getting to and from the airports and accessing the subway. The New Yorker has been our go to hotel in New York for several years. Location is perfect for getting to from the train and an easy walk to anything we could want. The hotel is very clean and well kept and some of the views are - Classic Hotel in a great location. The New Yorker boasts a fantastic location across the road from Penn Station and just minutes from Times Square and Macy's. The rooms are tired and dated and the carpets in rooms and halls need refreshing but the rooms, beds, and towels were spotless and cleaned daily. The hotel lobby is accessed via very grand revolving doors or extremely heavy doors which are near impossible if you have luggage. Location, price, room, restaurants and amenities were outstanding. I didn't realize the history of the hotel until I was there - such a cool history. As a woman traveling alone the security process and presence was incredibly comforting. The only thing I could ask to improved (in general) would be more gluten free (or even gluten conscious) meal options. The New Yorker Hotel is in a great location in New York City. The hotel is very outdated and the rooms are tiny. The shower just spat water at you and was like warm at best. No customer service and not releasing my pre authorised deposit! The location of the hotel is excellent with madison Square Gardens just across the road. The Wyndham New Yorker is a great place to stay in NYC. The rooms are dated but this adds to the delight of an older hotel. The location is excellent, next to penn street station and about a 20 min walk from time square. The tik tok diner adjoined to the hotel is amazing. The suite was bare. in the city.  paid a fortune for a 3 star suite. there was not even a box of tissues in the suite. There was nothing to sit outside.  why offer a balcony suite when you could not even see the city? "
Ameritania At Times Square,"The Ameritania is located near Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center and the Theater District. The rooms are well-equipped with what you need for a stay in the city. The front desk and doormen were always friendly and helpful. The service was amazing by lipa, Mohammed, majid. Ameritania at Times Square is one of the best hotels I have stayed at. The room felt like a boutique hotel experience - we had two full beds and the room felt huge for NYC accommodations! The bathroom and shower were modern, lots of storage space in the closet, and the hotel came with a complimentary umbrella for use. Ameritania Times Square Hotel is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel is within walking distance of many ""must see"" NY spots. Hotel is clean and convenient to everything. The concierge is like family to me. He goes above and beyond to help with whatever we need. Angelo's around the corner is superb. The Ameritania is located in the heart of Manhattan near Central Park and Times Square. The hotel provided complimentary tea/coffee in the morning and bottled water. The staff was able to hold our bags prior to checking in which allowed us to explore without carrying our luggage. The rooms are clean and spacious. The hotel is located in the heart of New York City. Free coffee and tea in the lobby every morning. No machines in rooms but it’s easy enough to go get drinks and take them back to the rooms. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room. Room was so hot and the air con was louder than the traffic from outside. The hotel is located in a great and convenient location. The room is small as expected but the furniture is damaged, the mattress is old. The toilet did not flush properly and the shower has no door meaning water all over the floor no matter how careful you are. This is the slowest check-in I have had at a hotel in years."
Courtyard by Marriott New York Manhattan / Midtown East,"The HVAC system in this building is not properly functioning. Room was large to Manhattan standards, perfect and large king bed. Good Gym and relax lounge on 12th floor with very useful computer and printer available. Microwave was made available in the room on request (useful to avoid having to eat out every night) The staff was very rude and dismissive. I would never stay at this place again. Avoid it at all costs!! - A Great Hotel Experience in Midtown ManhattanWe travel to NY City frequently and this is our ""go to"" hotel. The prices are reasonable (for NY City) The rooms are definitely larger than the average Manhattan hotel room. The Courtyard Midtown NYC is one of the biggest hotels in NYC. The rooms are clean, tv is big, bedding nice! The staff here is just phenomenal! From the moment you walk in, to every time you pass by the front desk they are extremely friendly. The hotel was clean, location was superb, and the overall service was 5 star. The size of the room exceeded my expectations, since it's in Manhattan I wasn't expecting to get such a large room. The free 12th floor office space in the hotel was a crucial bonus to setting up our 400 person event nearby. The rooms are very large (which is rare in New York City) and the staff was so friendly and helpful. For breakfast they have their own Starbucks on the 12th floor! We will stay here again. - A Great ExperienceWhen I arrived, Julissa Diaz couldn’t have been more helpful. - Good room, great people! The staff was unanimously friendly, helpful, and understanding of this family of 5. The room was clean, the cleaning staff tucked in our toddler’s snugglies, we had a great view. The location was great for subway rides to Central Park and Penn Station, and walks to both neighborhood restaurants."
Paramount Hotel Times Square,"The rooms are small, they are basic, but they come with a lot of additional facilities,  A large tv with cable, and a variety. The hotel is ideal for exploring NY and just needing a bed for the night. The staff are not overly helpful, we had an issue with our air con unit (in their extreme humid heatwave) and we asked someone to look at it twice, and no one ever came! The Paramount is located in midtown Manhattan, 30 seconds from Times Square. The hotel is very centrally located, convenient to all the theaters and the restaurants on 8th and 9th Avenues. The reception staff are very pleasant and helpful. The single room is small and during the rest of the year would be no problem. Location is excellent, very close to Times Square. I stayed in a single room. Of course, it was small, but it was clean and convenient. The staff were very kind. I left my luggage bags in the hotel after checkout, and they charged only $3. Location is the only positive for this hotel. Rooms are small for a family of 4. Beds could have been slighly bigger. People were smoking quite a bit of weed in the hallways but it's New York City and that appears normal. - Skip it, not worth it in any way. The hotel benefits from it's proximity to Times Square (less than a block) Sadly the hotel amenities, which looked amazing from the hotel's website were not as advertised. The hotel bar is but doesn't open until 5 pm but the ""game room"" area has been walled off and is hotel storage.....The hotel doesn't seem to think the year is 2024. The rooms are tiny and are in desperate need of updating. The thermostat was useless, difficult to control and turn on/off. The plug sockets are awful, make sure you take a type B socket as otherwise the plug will fall out of the wall. The customer service was very professional, and the staff are bilingual. Shabby, dirty, noisy and expensive. It needs a refurb or a deep clean. The photos on the website must have been taken years ago and are very misleading. Stay away  -   stay away from this place. It's a bad idea to go there."
The Manhattan at Times Square Hotel,"Disappointing place to stay despite the location. Our room was extremely shabby with wallpaper coming off the walls and the curtains hanging off and dust everywhere. The non upgraded rooms are a bit more aged but we’re still clean. The hotel staff is great, but the actual hotel is blah and the walls are thin! - Trip of a lifetime became a nightmare. The Manhattan at Times Square has been my go-to spot to stay in the city for the past few years. The attached parking garage makes driving into the city a convenient and affordable option. The location of the hotel could not be more perfect if you're in town for a show, and the staff are consistently kind, helpful, and accommodating at all times. The hotel is overlooking the city and a short walk to Times Square. The rooms aren't huge but they are clean, cozy, and quiet. The bathtub dripped nonstop... literally - Perfect getaway. The hotel is so dated it’s not been updated in probably 70 years. The hotel is in need of repair and renovations. The staff were very nice. The room had old carpets and no controls for air and heat. I would give the hotel now a 2 ⭐️ star. It has potential due to the great location. Needs updating ASAP. The Manhattan at Times Square is a great place to stay in the center of Manhattan. The rooms were huge and the shower room was unbelievable. The staff were so friendly. The room was dull, dated and musty looking and smelling. Do not answer front desk or housekeeping calls, ever! The Manhattan at Times Square Hotel is listed as a 3 star - Appalling!!! Do not stay at this hotel. We booked 2 rooms and requested 10 months in advance  adjoining rooms as had 2 children. When arrived did not get. Told ‘sorry’ only a request. Would have moved hotels then and there but non refundable. The hotel is located in a great location in New York City. The rooms are dated but clean and comfortable. The room tax is $50 per night, which for the standard of accommodation is exorbitant. There are bed bugs and the housekeeping staff are not interested. Decent hotel for location. Outdated in rooms, breakfast is grab and go no real restaurant. Location is great too but do not believe the photos of rooms on the website. I think they may be the executive rooms. Our room was only surface dusted. Bath had large crack and was covered in marks. Carpets wrinkly. Overall very tired and worn. Needs a total freshen up."
Hilton New York Times Square,"The Hilton Times Square is a perfect location near Times Square. The rooms are spacious, well appointed and on floors 22 -44, so great views, particularly on the upper floors. Staff were all great, respectful and were always glad to assist; great team. The only downside was the price of a full breakfast; 50 USD (plus tax) The Hilton Times Square is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel is located near Times Square and the Rockerfeller Centre. The room is on the 24th floor and is spotlessly clean with 2 Queen size beds and a massive TV and fridge in our room. Ciro Alarcon was amazing with his great service and pleasant attitude. Rooms were incredibly clean with stellar views. Staff was polite, professional and very helpful. Hotel is situated in a great location. Would highly recommend this location for a one-of-a-kind Times Square stay. The Hilton Times Square is a lot like the gum on your shoe. You don't see it, but once you step on it, you just got to deal with it. Do you enjoy paying for random and hidden fee's or predatory pricing similar to those of ultra low cost, de-bundled style airlines? Come stay at the Hilton Timessquare in NYC and enjoy $21 coffee!!! The view from our room was fabulous, and the staff was competent and pleasant. The thermostat could not be adjusted high enough to be comfortable, and we were chilly most of the time. The room needed repainting, as there were many chips and scrapes, especially in the bathroom. Hotel room was clean and had everything needed. Windows were dirty so poor view from window. Lack of transparency with “resort fee” and “complimentary” $35/night to spend in hotel which you get charged for. $18 credit offered - didn’t even cover the cost of 1 drink, which when you’re paying nearly $500 for a room is disappointing. The staff at this Hilton are phenomenal in particular the breakfast and lobby bar. I would highly recommend selecting this hotel for your next visit to  New York City. The rooms are strangely large especially by New York city standards. Brown water running from the tap in my bathroom was absolutely disgusting, the color of sewer water! We were told it's hotel policy for early check-ins. This was a first for me - I have travelled to 32 countries and have not experienced this. We were told the room is ready but you can't check in unless you pay or you can wait 2 hours. Also, our room was not a king size."
Dream Downtown,"The hotel is very clean and quiet. It is very close to the city center and can be walked. The public spaces are clean and well maintained. The carpet looked like it hasn’t been updated in a decade. The bedding and bathroom were clean, but the bedding was worn through. The hotel is in an excellent location within Chelsea Meatpacking District. The room is very small. The TV signal would freeze every one to two minutes for 5 seconds. The shower valve would not maintain temperature, had to continuously adjust. The mattress was beyond crappy, all springs and noisy. The view of the pool.... Skip this room. The staff at Dream Downtown are incredibly rude and have little to none customer service. Do not stay at this hotel if you would like a friendly, warm atmosphere as you will be sorely disappointed. We spent as little time as possible in this hotel and will not be returning. The hotel was beautiful and a good location. Staff was friendly and informative! We came for the Thanksgiving parade and some shopping and the location was perfect! Good location to restaurants and lots of site seeing! - Great experienceIs a beautiful hotel, well located in Chelsea area, all we needed. Does not include breakfast but there are some options near by. I would like to have better lighting in the room, mostly for doing my makeup. endly staff, awesome rooftop bar/lounge. Can't beat the location. Would definitely stay here again. Room was clean and efficient for the amount of space. Hotel bar opens at 5.  - Basic hotel for the price with broken hardware. The shower curtain is this metal mesh material that is both hard to manoeuvre and terrible for shower since it is harsh and cold on your body. The rooms are very small and poorly lit. The fire alarm went off at 6am. The beds are very low platform beds so if you have a hard time getting up this might not be the one for you. There are much more affordable hotels with nicer ameneties within a few blocks. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Manhattan. The hotel is one of the most expensive in the city. The rooms are dirty and the bed is uncomfortable. The staff at the front desk couldn't find me when checking in, even though the reservation was made through my corporate travel agency."
Hampton Inn Manhattan / Times Square Central,"The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of Broadway shows, restaurants, Times Square and subway stations. The lobby is very nice and doors are locked - no entry without a hotel key, which made us feel very safe. We were disappointed not to have a fridge in our room - so our leftovers were bad by morning. Staff were great, the breakfast far exceeded our expectation and the people helping and taking care of everyone were outstanding. The real gem of this hotel is the staff! They became family in just a couple of days! If something isn’t to your liking, just ASK! The hotel was very clean, and the lobby was decorated for the holidays. The manager saw us sitting in the lobby and introduced himself. The rooms are significantly smaller than they used to be. There are too few elevators, because going down from 7:30 to 9 in the morning you may have to wait for the elevator. The hotel is in a great location if you’re planning to see some shows. My room was spotless and the staff was very friendly, particularly in the breakfast room. I do wish they had more space for people to sit at breakfast as it got very crowded. The congestion in the room at the breakfast buffet made the buffet almost impossible to use.  Hampton Inn /Times Square Central is a great hotel to stay at if you want to be near Times Square. The location is perfect for a pre cruise stay. The staff are all so friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean and i feel safe. If i come back to nyc in the future, i’ll be coming  Location is excellent for Times Square, Central Park and subway stations. Hotel is good value, basic breakfast, rooms are clean and quiet. Hotel staff are professional, friendly and provide excellent customer service. A block from Time Square but not in the high pedestrian traffic way. Elevators are often full and took long to get up and down from our room. The rooms were clean, tidy and spacious, and the staff was amazing! The front office supervisor Jose Taveras was accommodating as well as the entire front desk staff and Security. Rooftop view was nice - Exceptional service. Breakfast 6-10am in large room features waffle irons, egg,sausage,potato, cereal breads and pastries. The hotel provides all of the services you need, to include a concierge. The complimentary breakfast is first rate, the rooms are super clean and cleaned daily. It seems that anything you need to help make your stay more enjoyable is a basic part of their job description."
"Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan, an IHG Hotel","Great for Times Square action but not not worth the price if you are exploring the whole city. Staff was friendly enough and I fell for being upsold to the Times Square view- don't do it! It’s neat to look down and see the activity but it is SO loud all night from motorcycles and screaming. Hotel is grossly overpriced without the most basic of amenities. Room is not soundproof so it is noisy and hard to sleep at night. Rooms are clean however. While this hotel is in a great location, it was a very poor room. The shower plate was falling off with dirt falling in the tub,  the phone was dead and the bathroom was unclean. For $500 a night it should have at least be clean and have a working phone for emergencies. Crowne Plaza Times Square is a great location for getting around Manhattan. The hotel bar had great service, truly friendly, and had food offerings as well. The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, plenty of hot water, and daily maid service. The breakfast “cafe” had many and delicious offerings. Crowne Plaza Times Square is located in the heart of Times Square. The hotel is in the process of doing major renovations to the - WORST FOURTH floor. No air conditioning in our room the entire weekend for an $800+ a night hotel. No microwave or mini fridge in a room when you're paying this much is crazy. The hotel was a huge disappointment. I paid $450 dollars per night for such a terrible experience. I had NO HOT WATER for 2 days the ac/heat did not work properly. The worst part of my stay was the loud noises from the vents. It sounded like the vents were breaking or gargling for two days... we weren't able to sleep. Crowne Plaza Times Square is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel has been experiencing problems with its computer system for weeks. The room was filthy and the bed was covered in blood. The housekeeper was wonderful and the staff was friendly. The only good thing about the hotel is the location. Crowne Plaza has a great location - it is within easy walking distance of the 50th Street ""E"" line subway which connects direct to the JFK Airtrain. The rooms are spacious and high up (starting 28th floor to 40+ floors) with very comfortable beds and large bathrooms. The temperature was 77 degrees in our room. The thermostat doesn't work in the room. Someone in the hotel sent room service to our room at 11:30 at night to antagonize us, because we complained that it was too hot to sleep the night before. Piss poor management. Rude unprofessional staff."
Warwick New York,"The Warwick Hotel is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel was the haunt of Elvis, the Beatles, Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, and now the Z list celebrity author of this review. The location is ideal for the holidays, and the hotel is close to Bloomingdale's, Serendipity, FAO Schwartz and Central Park. The Warwick was built by William Randolph Hearst for his girlfriend Marion Davies and their other famous friends. Cary Grant lived at the Warwick and the Beatles stayed there in the 60s. The hotel is well located and walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, Broadway and Rockefeller Center. Elevators are small and in high demand in the mornings. The Warwick is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel is in a great location, just minutes from Times Square and Central Park. The Randolph Bar off the Lobby is elegant & full of Business Execs relaxing after work. The rooms have a historic feel, nice decor and quite spacious. The Warwick is a charming hotel in a fantastic location - walking distance to Central Park, Bryant park, 5th Avenue, Broadway, Times Square, Empire State Building and many other key tourist sites. Furnishings are a little dated but it kind of added to the charm, and finding the right temperature on the shower took a bit of trial and error. It is easy to get to the Broadway shows (we did 3 this week) and loads of dinning spots near the home. The Warwick is located in Central Park, near Times Square and Central Park. The hotel has a great restaurant and many other options for meals. The rooms are comfortable and beautifully decorated. The service was great and the staff was pleasant. Cockroaches are a problem and the hotel is infested. The Warwick is a five star hotel at a perfect location in Midtown. The hotel itself is better than a motel if you like small rooms designed in the early 1990s. The Big City Hotel is around the corner from MOMA, a block from Fifth Avenue. Stayed at the Warwick for 6 nights with my partner & 2 children aged 13 & 10. Charming hotel in the heart of NYC midtown, close to Central Park, Moma, Times Square, metro station. Rooms are large and spacious however they are very tired looking and could do with updating and reinvigorating.  Warwick hotel New York is a real old-fashioned new york hotel. Not the swankiest,not the most famous but just a lovely quiet hotel that delivers exactly what you want. The bar is a great spot to lose a couple of hours and overall it is a nice place to retreat when you need a break from having fun around town."
Sanctuary Hotel New York," Sanctuary Hotel NYC is a great hotel on the doorstep of Times Square. The hotel has quite a buzz to it: it’s warm and the staff were very friendly. The room was quite compact but it was warm, surprisingly quiet considering the location. The shower was lovely - large and very warm with plenty of products supplied. The Sanctuary is a boutique hotel in the centre of New York City. We stayed just before Christmas and all the staff were so friendly and helpful, particularly Jonathan who helped us with our bags on our way in and out. The first room allocated had a musty smell and after reporting this to reception, we were swiftly moved to a room at the front of the hotel facing the street. The Sanctuary is located just off Times Square. The hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff make you feel very welcome. The Haven rooftop restaurant was not great. There is a small fitness room in the basement that has new equipment but just a single treadmill, elliptical, Peloton bike and weight machine. The Sanctuary Hotel is located in Times Square in the middle of everything you need to see. The Haven rooftop restaurant/bar is excellent and an obvious draw all day. The hotel bar is never open and when it was it closed at 2130 it put a downer on our Christmas holiday. The rooms are quite small - but what do you expect in themiddle of NYC?! The Sanctuary NYC is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel is located close to Time Square and is a short walk from Central Park. The suite has a queen bed, refrigerator and liquor, wine and snacks available for purchase in the room. Breakfast is included and was mostly carbs, coffee, and juice but great before heading out. New York Sanctuary is a quirky and excellent hotel. The staff in particular were superb, super helpful and friendly. Despite being so close to the hustle and bustle of NYC you don’t hear anything. The rooftop bar is also a hit, great food and cocktails! The Sanctuary Hotel is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel is located just minutes from Time Square. The rooms are very comfortable and the shower is in the room. The breakfast is very poor and very limited. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The room is very clean and the bathroom is very nice. The Sanctuary is convenient to all of the touristy places downtown. The continental breakfast is one of the better that I’ve had. The dining room does not have enough seats or tables this is the only real criticism. The place is dark, very dark. Do not expect any light at any time of day."
The Empire Hotel,"The Empire Hotel is in a great location adjacent to Lincoln Center. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room is very small and the bathroom is mouldy. The location is mediocre unless you are exclusively going to performances at Lincoln Square, location is -- at best -- mediocre. The manager is the best. The Empire Hotel is a great choice for Lincoln Center goers. The rooms are small but comfortable. The hotel has a dog friendly policy, and - Some Care Some Don't. The staff were professional and helpful from check-in to check-out. The location is as good as is gets if you are planning to attend a performance at Lincoln center. The Empire Hotel is located on the Upper West Side right across from Lincoln Center and near Central Park. The hotel is very festive, especially as it's the holiday season. This was my third stay here and I don’t think I’ll return. The stench on some of the floors and especially the “fitness room” was horrible….like sewage….and this has been the case all three visits. The Empire Hotel is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel has a rooftop bar/ restaurant, open late for views of Lincoln Center. The only redeeming feature is the convenient location to Lincoln Center, but the rooms are in poor condition. The staff at the Empire Hotel are outstanding and their service was exceptional. The Empire is a great location for a conference, but the rooms need some TLC. The rooms are tiny and the heating/cooling system isn't working. The staff is lovely and the location is wonderful, as others have noted it just doesn't meet standards. This hotel has so much potential but they need a major investment. The Empire Hotel, NYC, rocks! Exceptional service, luxurious comfort, and an overall delightful experience. No food or drink, except bottled water, available in the entire place. Shocking absence of any coffee. Perfect location  to visit the MET. - Showing its age. The hotel is located in the heart of New York City. The hotel has a great view of Lincoln Center and further north. Nearby restaurants are crowded and expensive. No room service. The next door restaurant is crazy noisy dark at dinner time. The rooms are dingy and the shower head was held together with duct tape."
The FIDI Hotel,"We are in love with this hotel. Close to the subway so you can get anywhere in the city fast. Clean and nice rooms!! Love the decor too (nice art, wall paper, tiles).. sometimes new and interesting. You can actually see some attractions within walking distance, so a big plus. Always happy to be back to The Fidi Hotel. The FIDI Hotel is in the Financial District of New York City. The rooms are on the small side but considering it is in a heart of manhattan not surprising. The look of the hotel is very modern and elegant, very nice music in the public area and very nice sent. The rooms are very nice size, cozy, very confutable bed and very peaceful. The bathroom appliances are high end and very large size for a hotel especially in NYC. The hotel is brand new and very sophisticated, large rooms with sound proof windows.

The agents are so helpful and pleasant. The hotel is very nice, with modern and clean rooms. The staff are extremely polite, responsive and willing to help, especially Yovan and Aliyah. The hotel is new and modern, so everything feels very fresh which I loved, as well as being super clean. The location is perfect, the subway is very close and you can get to so many different neighbourhoods in a matter of minutes. Beside a weed shop, you'll smell Marijuana when you go out the hotel. The hotel is in a perfect location for everything you need, bars, resturants, subway, shops. The price was right for nine days, but there were some things we had to figure on doing without. All of the rooms are extremely dark - as both sides face large office buildings. stay at The Fidi Hotel last week! We booked online for a last minute work/play trip and we saw it was brand new- it looked great in the photos but was better in person! So cool and hip! Here are the highlights:  The Staff:  Wonderful check-in experience. The Room: WOW. Floor to ceiling windows, which made the room so bright and airy. The bathroom was on the small side but the shower pressure was fantastic. There was a - Chic and Comfortable. oom is only good for 1 person. Even if we wanted to call for room cleaning, we opt not to coz our luggages occupied the floor area. Location - not ideal, far from the main attractions. No restaurants near the area that open late in the - Cheap hotel and mediocre customer service."
Hotel Malte - Astotel,"The hotel is in a safe and convenient location. Easy 10-15 min. walk to the Louvre, Place Vendome, and the Seine. Bistros/restaurants with assorted cuisines and cafes are all within blocks. The block where the hotel is located is surrounded by busy areas so it can get a little noisy.

Breakfast had a good selection with an egg station. Staff were helpful and most speak English as well as French. - A Real Find! The hotel is in the Les Halles area of Paris. It is near the bakery that serve probably the best croissant in Paris, it is directly above Paris RER (so it is really easy to commute to Versailles or even Disneyland Paris), near Metro/Bus Station and it is walking distance to points of interest. The Chatelet - Les Halles metro station is on a short, direct line from CDG Airport, and to our delight, it is also on the direct line out to Disneyland. The restaurant is located inside a hotel, but the garden you’ll be eating in is without roof and very nice. Novotel Paris Les Halles is located in the heart of the French capital. The hotel is close to the Metro and is close enough to cafes and restaurants. The concierge was exceptionally pleasant and super helpful in giving us suggestions to restaurants, places to visit and how to get around. The hotel is modern, very comfortable, and very clean.

Grand Hotel du Palais Royal,"The staff at the Grand Hotel du Palais Royal were so friendly and helpful. The bed is comfy, the rooms are chic and the staff is accomodating. The only thing that was quite pricey was the minibar and a bottle of sparkling water for  EUR23 at Café 52. The hotel is in a great location, near the Louvre and walking distance to restaurants. The food is better than the Giraffe and Gigi and almost every restaurant we visited in recent days. The hotel upgraded my room, which certainly brightened up my vacation. The breakfast is amazing, the staff is excellent, and the location couldn't be better. The hotel is beautiful and clean, and the location is great. The team are unfailingly friendly and responsive. Everyone greeted me by name and it felt like home away from home. The smiles were real; it’s clear they take pride  in, and enjoy what they do. The hotel lobby is almost-suffocatingly filled with cologne or perfume, almost where you get that feeling of almost having a resistance to breathing, when you're next to someone wearing too much cologne. Received a ""complimentary breakfast"" with my stay with Chase Rewards, but wasn't told that it only included the generic buffet. The staff at Grand Hotel du Palais Royal is exceptional. The location and the rooms are lovely. The breakfast was great and the location is right in the middle of everything to see in Paris.

Cler Hotel,"Hotel Cler is in a great location just a five minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. It is located on Rue Cler, which is filled with many shops and restaurants. Breakfast at this hotel was very good and the breakfast staff worked very hard to make sure it was enjoyable for us.

Hotel Marignan Champs-Elysees,"The hotel is perfectly located near the Champs Elyesses. Rooms are very small and it is quite noisy but overall a good visit. Pricing IMO is too high for this space. You are def paying for location and not to be in the room though… - Great hotel and wonderful customer service. Hotel Marignan Champs-Elysees is located in the heart of Paris. The hotel is in such a great location walking distance to many places. The staff at this hotel made you feel at home like you are family or friends to them. The location is so convenient, the room is generous and nice. Staff were very friendly, rooms were clean, breakfast was delicious. The minimum temperature is set at 19°C, which was a little bit warmer than we like. Location near Arc Triomphe and Eiffel Tower was excellent and our room was very comfy. The hotel has a very nice location, just off the champ élysées avenue so it's great for that. The room we stayed in had a high ceiling, and they had built a ""bathroom"" level in a way, where you took the stairs to that level inside the same room. The food is also very good and the location ist super. The location is fantastic, just by the Champs Elysees, perfect for a stroll. Breakfast and dinner at the hotel was very enjoyable. The hotel ambiance is relaxing with lovely lounge areas and street-side tables. The rooftop terrace was closed for renovation, and we had looked forward to that. The Eiffel Tower suite has an excellent view of the Eiffels Tower. Within walking distance of many things but far enough away from the Champs-Elysees to feel like you are not right in the middle of a tourist spot. The staff at Hotel Marignan were really great at helping us get our vowel renewal event on their rooftop set up. The car service was easily available for our family during our stay. The hotel is in a location where luxury stores are less than a block away. The champs elysee and the arc are at walking distance. Highly recommended for families.  -  - The hotel was a great choice for a family-friendly stay."
Hotel Piapia,"The room was clean and modern with a touch of Parisian flair. The ability to have hot drinks free of charge is a nice touch. The only thing that needs to be improved lies in the breakfast. While the options are fresh, it is exactly the same every single day. The hotel was one metro stop from the main train station, then a 5min walk to hotel. The room was clean and tidy with ample space for unpacking clothes. The shower cubicle was spacious, and good shower with free toiletries. The only mirror is in the bathroom none in the actual room. The Piapia Hotel in Paris was a reasonably priced place to stay in Paris. The hotel is close to metro and has a supermarket and several nice eateries local for the nights we arrived back from Disney and needed to eat. The free water and hot drinks throughout the day was a godsend. Hotel is cozy, in a good location, and staff is very friendly. Noise from hallway can be heard in the rooms, and space is tight if sofa bed is opened. No parking available but there’s a parking garage about a 7 minute walk away. The hotel was recently renovated, so everything is in top condition. Air conditioning also works well, which was a big plus, as the summer weather reached 40 degrees. The staff are the nicest people you can meet. The location is bit far from the central but there's a metro station 200 m from the hotel. The hotel is in a perfect location, out of the hustle and bustle but right next to bus stops and metros that take you anywhere you want to go in around 30 mins. The staff at reception were always very welcoming and helpful. The hotel was very clean and the bed was so comfortable! The location felt very safe and had great transportation links. Would recommend to friends and family!"
Hotel Moliere,"Hotel Molière is located in the heart of Paris. The hotel is a beacon of comfort and style that won't break the bank. The prime location ensures that you're never far from the action, whether it's exploring the museums, the vibrant cityscape or unwinding in a nearby cafe. Hotel Molière is a little gem in the First Arrondissement. It is tucked away on a quiet street just a 10 minute walk from the Louvre and the Seine river. The reception and breakfast room were compact but, in my opinion, added to the hotel's charm. Our premium room was well appointed and immaculately clean; nothing to complain about. Hotel Moliere is centrally located on a quiet street in the First Arrondisement. It is an easy walk to the Louvre, Orsay, and the Tuileries. The front desk is very helpful and cordial. There is a good French bakery, Asian owned, right next door. Hotel Moliere is a boutique hotel in central Paris. Staff are friendly and helpful and the room is very quiet. The bathroom layout with a glass wall that didn't offer much privacy. The windows are not very noise cancelling. Shower was broken and I cut my hand while operating it. Hotel Moliere is just a few minutes walk from the Seine, Louvre and Musee D’Orsay. The rooms are modern and comfortable. The food is wonderful and the view is to die for. The staff are friendly and the spa is great. The hotel is minutes from the Louvre and the Tulleries. The room was tasteful, spacious, spotless, and comfortable. The choice of breakfast options is very limited and guests need to undertake a treasury hunt to discover where is the bread, where are the croissants and pains au chocolate."
citizenM Paris Champs-Elysees,"CitizenM hotel is located in the heart of the city, just a few steps from the Champs Elysees. The rooftop bar had a great view of the Eiffel Tower but no heaters so bring something warm ( they did have a few blankets near entrance) Cafe azur is a few minutes walk away. CitizenM Champs Élysées is just off the Champs-Elysees. It is in walking distance of Arc de Triomphe, Place de la Concorde and Jardin des Tuileries. The rooms are small, but the lounges are comfy with plenty of room to relax. CitizenM is just steps off the Champs-Elysees so pretty much perfect! The Rooftop bar with view of Eiffel Tower at night was a great plus as well! - Amazing place. The service and the team was exceptional and the location was the best as it is in the heart of Paris. CitizenM is in a great location to many high-end stores, as well as the many area attractions. The rooms are small, as others have said, but we didn’t have an issue with ours. The decor is very interesting with lots of artwork around and the lobby/dining areas were a great place to hang out. CitizenM Champs Elysées is a great place and location to stay in Paris. It is within walking distance from one of France's iconic monuments, the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel guests are in for a treat as there are stores for both luxury and quotidian shopping. thing has compared to the staff, location, and quality of stay here. We will absolutely be on the lookout for one of their hotels at our future destinations. The courtyard and the view of the Eiffel Tower was amazing. The hotel was the perfect location to visit all sites by walking or taking the metro."
Hotel du Danube Saint Germain,"Hotel du Danube is located on the Left Bank of Paris. The hotel is located a short walk from the Seine and the Louvre.

Hotel B55,"Remote location, sub par breakfast. WiFi pretty weak. High quality toiletries. While the room is well insulated from the outside, not so from the hallway, of which every noise can be heard. The hotel controls the climate system and the room was way too hot - in December… Breakfast was a chaos everyday. Many things run out all the time., tables were not cleared for a long time. We thought that the pastries were not in par - not for France, not for a 4 stars hotel. Hotel B55 is located close to the Left and Right Bank of Paris. The pool has a limit of four people and operates a booking system. Each room comes with an espresso machine and a wine fridge. The hotel facilities are modern and excellently maintained. The reception staff are fantastic. Hotel B55 is located in a very convenient location. The rooms are very comfortable and the facilities are excellent. The staff are very friendly and the rooms are finished to a high standard. The area is away from the hustle and bustle of central Paris, but alive enough so you feel part of the city. Hotel B55 has a pool, sauna and is close to Montsouris and Cité internationale universitaire de Paris. The hotel is approximately 25 mins away from central Paris attractions by bus or Metro. Hotel staff are the loveliest I have ever encountered in Paris. Hotel De Ville is located in the Latin Quarter of Paris. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the Glacière metro station. There is no restaurant or bar, but there is a coffee machine and a snack area. Hotel has a sauna that needs to be booked and costs €35 for the duration of your stay. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood and very unassuming. It is a 10 minute walk to the subway, though there is are a number of buses on the corner. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance (Pizza San Giovanni is right down the street and has to die for Italian). Hotel B55 Paris is located in a quiet neighborhood near the heart of Paris. The hotel has an indoor pool and bathrobes re provided in room. Free breakfast is included and, for me, the highlight was fresh squeezed orange juice. Rooms were very comfortable, with beautiful bathrooms. Swimming pool and Sauna were small.....but still luxurious. The hotel appears to be very new. The high-tech, eco-friendly ambience worked well. Breakfast was very full by French standards. The rooms are spacious and beautiful with huge beds and smart TVs, with windows opening out onto the street below. The front desk staff are great, they can't do enough to make you feel welcome."
Hotel Europe Saint Severin,"Hotel Europe Saint Severin is located in the Latin quarter of Paris. The hotel lost its 5th star due to very cold temperature and very few and hard-to-reach electrical outlets. Room was very cool-looking, under the rooftop with apparent wood beams. Hotel was small but comfortable clean and quiet. Requested a quiet room and was given a room which opened out to the inner courtyard. Stayed 5 nights solo trip and felt safe. Awesome location, restaurants everywhere, 5 mins to river & Metro, close to Luxembourg Gardens and Notre Dome. Hotel Severin is located in the Latin Quarter of Paris. The hotel is within walking distance of all of Paris' best attractions. Staff discriminated Asian and used French to gossip about you. Hotel has a lift and a good sized lift at that! We didnt have breakfast or dine at property as to many options around to choose from. Hotel ranks as one of the coolest I've ever been in, in terms of unique looks, comfort and location. The room itself with its high stone and wood ceilings, elegant but warm look, bathtub in one end of the main room, and comfortable bed, was superb. The breakfast was tasty, more varied than most, and was held in a small charming restaurant in the hotel ground floor. The hotel is in a great location near Notre Dame, St. Germain de Pres, Ile St. Loius, Luxembourg Gardens, the Marais and the Louvre. The rooms were tidy but much smaller than the photos. The staff were incredible helpful and very accommodating. The hotel is in a historic building so some of the comforts you may be used to won’t be present (like AC) but windows open for airflow, and you can watch the action in the street below. The nightlife in the area is also always on, so keep in mind if you're a light sleeper."
Citadines Tour Eiffel Paris,"Citadines for is located in a great place, close to the Eiffel Tower, Paris Military School, shops, restaurant, and accessible public transportation. The lobby was small but cozy, the decor was pretty modern, it was pretty clean, and the more importantly the front desk agents were really helpful and kind. The rooms are spacious and clean, but what I loved most was the well-stocked kitchenette which included dishes, pots, pans, silverware, and everything you could need in a kitchen! The location is great, just a few steps away from the metro and surrounded by cafes, shops, and restaurants. Citadines Eiffel Tower is an Affordable hotel apartment in Paris city center. Hotel is 100% wheelchair accessible, but you need to call the front desk before arrival to make sure an accessible unit is booked for you. Staff is very helpful welcoming and caring, and the rooms are spotless clean and spacious and have everything you need. The hotel has amazing views of the Eiffel Tower, but the service was terrible. Housekeeping never showed up to clean our rooms. The staff double-charged us. The hotel itself is better suited for longer stays. It is well-within walking distance to major attractions. Citadines Tour Eiffel Paris is a serviced apartment hotel in Paris, France. The hotel is located in a perfect area, but the noise from the subway station is too loud. The rooms are small, so don't expect American style rooms. Housekeeping & towel change are not available. Cecil Hotel Paris is located in the heart of Paris. The hotel has a great location and is close to the metro and the eiffel tower. The rooms are very spacious and the apartment is very clean. The food is very good and the hotel is very cheap. The rooms are a great size and having the apartment style set up is wonderful. The location is wonderful and it is a very easy walk up to the Eiffel Tower. The staff was very helpful, especially Valentina who did our check-in and continued to help us throughout. Citadines is a great place to stay in Paris. The front desk staff is amazing, and the property is very well kept. The studio was very spacious and had all the basics. The hotel is well connected by Metro and Bus and you can get anywhere very quick. The hotel is situated in the midst of town, with convenient shopping, great restaurants and the metro, surprisingly quiet, right at your door. Had a Eiffel tower balcony view room and the view did not disappoint was absolutely amazing and so nice to see everyone from the room or balcony."
Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower Hotel,"The hotel is central to most attractions, and there is a metro station at the end of the street. Staff were very friendly and accommodating, Dinner and breakfast in the restaurant were excellent, high quality and well priced for the area. Terrible New Year’s Eve Event, did not worth the money-not recommended for events this hotel. The room view is sooooo good, recommend to request high floor to not hearing a noise disturb from the road and any smell of cigaratte from ground floor. The shower gel and other liquid wasn't refilled. One night the room door got jammed and the keycard didn't work and the hotel staff acted as if we didn't know how to use the card. The Pullman Paris is located by the Eiffel Tower and has a great view from the 5th floor balcony. The hotel charges deposit and it's hard to get it back into your account when you check-out. The rooms have no temperature control and it is stifling. The front desk staff are not helpful. The Pullman is a good centrally located hotel in Paris. The location is next to the Eiffel Tower, plenty of restaurants and shops in the area. The carpets are filthy an should have been deep cleaned before anyone was assigned this room. There are literal holes in the wall where the toilet dispenser goes. The bathroom was dirty, I had to squish a bug on the floor, and there was an open half-used orange juice in the refrigerator. The only good thing is the breakfast and convenient location. The service is horrible. They did not clean our room and no working phone. The carpeting had so many stains in it, it was disgusting. The Pullman Paris is located in central Paris. The hotel is within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. The rooms are amazing and the location is central. The views from the rooms of the tower are magnificent. The room is very spacious and the breakfast is excellent. The rooms are some of the largest and modern in Paris. The reception is very slow and the rooms are in need of a little TLC. The hotel was also the meeting point for a number of tours including the Claude Monet Gardens tour and the Versailles Palace. The Australian Embassy was also in the same street. The Eiffel Tower was undoubtedly the highlight of the experience. However, my overall impression was slightly dampened by the lack of friendliness from some of the hotel staff. While not all encounters were negative, there were instances where I felt the staff could have been more accommodating and welcoming."
Hotel Tourisme Avenue,"One night in Paris my family stayed at the Hotel Tourisme Avenue as we had a layover in Paris for 1-night on our way home. The location was great for accessing the Eiffel Tower and there were many restaurants in the area. The hotel was very clean, staff friendly and the room was spotless. e Hotel in the Heart of Paris was wonderful. The location is great near most attractions In Paris. The staff was very nice the rooms were clean and beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were beautiful. - The photos are not an accurate example of what you are actually booking. Hotel Tourisme Avenue is close to the Eiffel Tower and metro station with 3 lines. Clean rooms, nice and friendly personal. Tons of restaurants to choose from within a block or two. Access to metro right next door. Favourite hotel in Europe. The hotel is in a Superb location, near Eiffel Tower. The restaurant next door was our favorite for onion soup! Walking to the Eiffels at night was safe. Staff was so helpful and kind. Close to the Hop on and Hop off. Coffee in Lobby was a plus!  I would stay here again! - Jessica at the front desk- amazing. Hotel is in a great location, right across the street from a Metro station. The room was small, but very functional. The staff was pleasant and very easy to deal with. There are lots of dining options in the immediate area. We did hear the Metro trains at night but were easily able to sleep through it. The hotel was wonderful, the staff were amazing. The beds were the best I’ve slept in on the trip. The location of the was perfect, we had wonderful walks and the Eiffel Tower was only a short stroll away. Make sure you visit the EIFFel Tower at 10pm, magical! - tourist tripservice."
Grand Hotel Malher,"An amazing, well-located place to stay. Close to the Saint Paul Metro and a shopping area with helpful amenities. Staff at check-in and during our whole stay were friendly, helpful, simply fabulous! Rooms a bit small but very comfortable and clean. A/C worked perfectly!!! Temperatures during our stay in Paris were running 96F/35C. The Grand Mahler is a modern hotel in an old building. The existing footprint is very small and the elevator and rooms match this scale. The bed and sheets are extremely comfortable. The AC works perhaps a bit too well. The hotel could make a few improvements to the room and some communication issues with the staff need to be addressed. in fantastic location. The rooms were spotless and very comfortable (special shout-out for the unusually large bathroom), and there was even excellent air conditioning. Best of all is the truly perfect location, literally a one-minute walk from the St. Paul metro (on line 1, which takes you to many sightseeing points of interest) The hotel is located in the heart of Le Marais, a short pleasant walk to all the hip boutiques, Picasso Museum, great cafes and restaurants, Place de Vosges and Victor Hugo's house. The room is clean, bed and pillows very comfortable( queen sized bed), and bathroom was recently remodeled. GHM is located right next to the Saint-Paul bus (#69) and metro (#1) stops. The shower is AMAZING (a ""rain shower"") and the A/C works well. The WiFi is a little iffy; at times it's very fast, and at others it slows to a crawl. The elevator is very small; it can fit one person with a suitcase. The Grand Hotel Mahler is located in the Marais area of Paris. The hotel is close to the Rue de Rivoli and the Saint Paul metro station. Breakfast is taken in an ancient cellar which like the rest of the hotel is filled with character - Internet is unusable. The hotel is located in the Marais, Paris's chic 3rd arrondissement, just a few blocks from the Place des Vosges and a short work from the Saint Paul metro stop. The rooms are, as one might expect in Parisian budget hotels, small, but the two of us and all our baggage fit in comfortably. WiFi worked well; there is a nice TV (albeit, mostly French-language channels) and a comfortable bed. The room was clean, bedding comfortable, bathroom very nice. Friendly staff and perfectly placed near st paul subway station in the marais. Only thing (totally personal), there are no boiler in the room :( all the rest is perfect for a mid range hotel. Great for a week end in Paris."
The People - Paris Belleville,"The hostel is a great place for young and middle aged travelers. The neighborhood also has a lot to offer. There is a market on the street in front of the building that takes place on Tuesdays and Fridays. The bar downstairs was very cute, rooftop also fun. Nearby Belleville train was convenient. The People hostel is one of the best hotels in Paris. The rooms and washrooms are very clean, the hostel felt safe, check-in and out was efficient, and the staff were friendly. The rooftop terrace has Eiffel Tower & Sacre Coeur views and is perfect for admiring the beauty of Paris. The bed had a curtain and own lamp and power outlet, which made staying comfortable. There was no common kitchen guests could use, but it was ok to eat outside food in the lobby. The rooms have lockers and curtains on the bed which is positive. Location of hostel is quite far out from ‘ attractions’ but there’s a metro station nearby so it doesn’t matter. The People hostel is located in a good area of Paris. The staff is very friendly and the location is very close to metro stations. The shower was one of our favorites of all the hostels we stayed in. The lockers and hooks in the room are also nice but beware that some of the beds have the outlet blocked. The People - Paris Belleville Hostel is a good one. The bed is very comfortable and bathrooms are so clean and good. The rooms are new and clean. The people from reception are amazing. I really recommend it. - lovely and chill place to stay at! The bed and showers were excellent! Super comfortable, and clean. Staff were so kind, helpful, and patient. The downstairs doubles as a bar which had comfy seats and activities going on every night. I had the second shortest bed (still a bottom bunk) and found it slightly difficult to get in. If you have any physical impairment, I would definitely request the shortest bed. The People-Belleville is a great hostel in Paris. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the privacy curtains are a nice touch. The rooftop terrace is lovely and a perfect place to meet other travelers. The bar and patio downstairs were perfect also, and they have weekly live jazz music on Thursdays."
Hotel Square Louvois,"The Hotel Square Louvois is located just 10 minutes from the Louvre and Tuileries Garden Christmas Market. The hotel has a gym, afternoon tea, and an option for a breakfast buffet. The spa downstairs has a swimming pool and gym, but the pool is not heated. The hotel was a perfect choice for a Paris Hotel! The staff was great before we arrived (I had numerous questions) and during our stay. The breakfast buffet was lovely. The rooms were clean and elegant. And, only a short walk to the Louvre. There is a nice park across the street, too. It's the best hotel I have stayed at in Paris. The Hotel Square Louvois is a boutique hotel in the heart of Paris. It is located on a quiet street but with plenty of bistros nearby. The hotel is located in a great area and has lots of local shops and amazing restaurants.

Luxury hotel in the heart of Paris. Close to Louvre and dozens of restaurants. Overpriced but good value for money. Staff were all amazing. Room was small compared to the US, but that is common in Paris. The pool is a super cool area and very unique. Hôtel Louvois is located in the Marais area of Paris. The hotel is located near the Grand Boulevards and the Opéra Garnier. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are stylish and have everything you need to stay in Paris."
Hotel du Printemps,"Hotel is very clean and in a great location close to the metro. Staff are very accommodating and friendly. Location is good for metro and RER, area around Picpus is lovely for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Breakfast in hotel is lovely and good for day ahead of site seeing. Hotel du Printemps has been renovated very well. The rooms are teeny tiny, but seem all very new, sparkling clean and well appointed. Free wifi was not enough to stream any movies, but it worked well for checking email, etc. The breakfast was much more than a typical french breakfast. Hotel is ideally located in zone 1 of Paris with the Metro station ""Nation"" around 650 meters away (well within walking distance) There are numerous eateries nearby but these seemed a bit overprice for the quality of the food they served. Room had a wet room walk-in shower, and WiFi was free with the hotel room booking. The rooms are small compared to North American standards but didn't bother us. The staff were very friendly both day and night staff and kitchen staff. The hotel is very close to the Metro and many places to eat close by. The room was quite small, but we didn't really spend much time there and the bed was comfortable. The Hotel du Printemps is a great value given the convenient location in Paris. The staff was exceptional. The room was cozy and very clean. The location is absolutely wonderful, being near many great restaurants (try Le Cosy and Nona Rita!) and a quick walk to two metro stations. Port hub, in a nice, tranquil neighbourhood. Staff really friendly and helpful. Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, good heating/air conditioning, strong WiFi, good TV channels, good breakfast. - Best place to stay in ParisBest place one could stay at in Paris! Amazing warm hospitality, cozy rooms, lovely breakfast well connected to metro Picpus and nation, and buses.

The room was spacious enough, had a functioning TV, a very comfortable bed and a nice overall temperature. All napkins and tablecloths were recycled paper, the food served on the breakfast was all organic, even the shampoos were bio."
St Christopher's Inn Canal Paris,"St Christopher's is a hostel in the centre of Paris. The rooms are small and the rooms are noisy. There is a bar on the ground level and a bar in the basement. It is a short stay, not a long one. The manager is abusive and dangerous female travellers beware. St Christopher's Inn Paris - Canal is one of the best hostels I've stayed in. Rooms are hot, no air conditioning and the door handle on our room was finicky. Terrible customer service. The lack of transparency and failure to honor the refund rightfully due to me was deeply disappointing. The shower drain is blocked, so you better like having your feet in the water of the previous person that just showered. Toilet was a bit dirty, Pillow sheet torn, Blanked torned, noisy bed, broken locker. People going there are a little too party type. This is a very cute part of Paris and only ten minutes in a cab to Gare du Nord. The shower flooded the bathroom making it a bit of a slip risk but the front desk staff were brilliant and couldn’t do enough to help. The room was spacious, bathrooms good and staff friendly. St Christopher's hostel is about 30 min from the city centre with the metro. The bar is definitely the best part of the place, lots of like-minded travellers hanging out, perfect place to start a night out. The location is close to metro stations, but to walk it's a bit far from theCity centre. St Christopher Inn Canal, Paris is a great place to stay in Paris. Staff were friendly and the food quality was almost good. The restaurant had a discount for the people staying in the hotel. The common bathrooms are clean and there are many. I would definitely recommend it for groups of friends that are planning a cheap but nice weekend. The only drawback is that there’s no small fridge in private  en-suite rooms which is a complete disappointment. Usually August in Paris have - Clean, friendly, positive, great location nearby transport. Good size bedrooms with powerpoints, cutains, comfortable beds and cleaned every day. Bathrooms could be tidied up. Good security. Friendly helpful staff. Location interesting, metro not far away."
St Christopher's Gare du Nord Paris,"The hostel is in a decent location, close to Montmartre and Gare du Nord. The food in Belushis is also quite good. The common area does not get cleaned often, and as a result there are rodents living there. If you're flying solo and hoping to mingle, this place isn't winning any awards. The Bonvoy app promises quick check-in, which couldn't be farther from the truth. The staff at the hotel are super nice; I can only feel sorry for them. The location is perfect near Gare du Nord Hôtel is for night life. The breakfast is very poor just very basic. St Christopher's Inn is a large fun hostel based on 6 floors. Facilities include,bar,restaurant,laundry,WiFi microwave and kettle. There is no kitchen but breakfast is served for €6/7. Rooms on high floors better for noise. The room is cold as a fridge because there is no heating!!! It looks more like an overpriced prison dump with security than a hostel. There are only 4 showers on the whole floor with ""hundred"" people staying. There is security in front of the hostel asking you for your card, then you have to check in 4 times in order to get to your room. The staff were so lovely and helpful! I needed to print off some visas and they happily helped. The rooms and the bed were very comfortable. Would definitely stay again!! - Very rude stuff. No one expecting for even a good service from this hostel stuff but no need to be rude and highbrow to the customers. St Christopher's hostel is located near the gare du nord station in Paris. The hostel surrounds a restaurant/bar/club. This is good when you want to eat at the hostel, this is bad when it's 2 AM on the weekend and you can't sleep because the music is blasting. Good bar and lounge areas,Elaine house manager on reception was excellent. Very little noise at night considering hundreds of guests staying. Great hostel. Staff are friendly and rooms are clean and spacious. The curtains across the beds are a great idea for privacy and to get sleep  lockers under beds."
Hotel Campanile Paris Bercy Village,"The hotel is in a great location just 5 minutes from the metro station. The room is very small, even for European standards. The bathroom is also tiny, the shower is so small there is no room to move. The only positive about this hotel was the breakfast. Hotel is located near the Accor Arena. 5 minute walk to metro so easy access to all sight seeing attractions. Great breakfast with Tropicana juice and fresh coffees. Friendly staff. Very clean bed sheets, although rooms were small for a city break this was okay. The Campanile is a quiet hotel in the centre of Bercy village. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was small and the aircon noisy but the breakfast was great. The croissants deserve a special mention as they were excellent. There's a little bar which shuts at midnight. There was a problem with our shower. Kyriad Bercy Hotel Paris is located in the arrondissement 12, near Bercy Village. Nearby are restaurants, cinema, mini supermarkets and clothes shops. The rooms are small but the beds are comfortable and with sparkling linens. The bath can be small but is super clean and with clean towels all time. The hotel is just two blocks from the Cour St. Emillion metro station. It is also just five minutes from Bercy Village, a renovated area that used to be wine warehouses. The hotel is located in the centre of Paris and is easy to get to from Gare Du Nord. Kyriad hotel is located in the Bercy area, the nearest metro stop being Cour St-Emilion (line 14) - only 3 stops from Chatelet. The hotel is standard in every way, not pretentious at all, but offering basic service with not so basic prices. Hotel breakfast - A gem in Paris (for the price)!! Kyriad Hotel Paris Bercy Village is a mid-range hotel with a subway close by. Located very near to Metro station and bus stop is also just outside of hotel so it is very easy to get around city using public transportation. Many reataurants/bars available just outside metro station and hence easy availability of food. The Hotel is close to the metro station Cour Saint-Emilion (line 14), in a nice area, with plenty of shops and restaurants, in Bercy Village. Within 15 minutes you can reach the city center / Chatelet Les Halles, still using metro line 14. The rooms are clean, maybe a little uninspired. Breakfast is very nice, the pains au chocolat are top of class!"
